<p class="head1"><b>COMPILERS&#8217; NOTE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The American Law Institute was formed in 1923 as the outgrowth of a &#8220;Committee on the Establishment of a Permanent Organization for the Improvement of the Law.&#8221; Its members were to be 400 practitioners, judg- es and law professors; there are now about 4500. The idea of the Institute, and of &#8220;restating&#8221; the law, was broached by Professor William Draper Lewis and fostered by Elihu Root and others. The Carnegie Corporation supported work on the original Restatement, comprising nine subjects, which was completed by 1944.</p>
<p class="indent">Contracts was one of the first three subjects upon which the Institute began work, and the Restatement of Contracts was completed in 1932. Professor Samuel Williston acted as Reporter, with responsibility for preparing drafts. (Professor Arthur L. Corbin served as Reporter for the Chapter on Remedies.) Other experts in the subject were formed into a Committee of Advisers who conferred with the Reporter over the whole period in producing drafts for submission to the Council of the Institute. The plan was &#8220;that the drafts of the different chapters submitted to the Council shall be the product of the committee composed of the Reporter and his advisers; that these drafts after discussion and amendment by the Council and before revision shall be submitted as tentative drafts for criticism and suggestion with a view to their improvement to the annual meetings of the Institute and to bar associations and the profession gen- erally.&#8221; Restatement of Contracts, Introduction, p. x. Final promulgation depended on approval of the text by both the Council and the full meeting of Institute members. The same procedure was followed in making revi- sions and in preparing the Restatement, Second.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1962 the Institute initiated the preparation of the Restatement, Second, of Contracts, parts of which are reproduced here. Professor Rob- ert Braucher served as Reporter until his appointment to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1971; he was succeeded by Professor E. Allan Farnsworth. The work was completed in 1980.</p>
<p class="indent">As originally conceived, the first Restatement was to be accompanied by treatises citing and discussing case authority, but experience proved that group production of such volumes was not feasible. As they stand, the Restatements consist of sections stating rules or principles (the so- called black letter), each followed by one or more comments with illustra- tions, and in the Restatement, Second, also by Reporter&#8217;s Notes in which supporting authorities are collected. (Reproduced here are the black letter <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of selected sections and in a few instances their comments and illus- trations.)</p>
<p class="indent">Assaults on the Restatement, along with sympathetic appraisals, have produced a rich literature. An eminent critic of the Restatement of Con- tracts immediately objected that the American Law Institute &#8220;seems con- stantly to be seeking the force of a statute without statutory enactment.&#8221; Clark, The Restatement of the Law of Contracts, 42 Yale L.J. 643, 654 (1933).<b><sup>1</sup></b> To what measure of authority is the Restatement entitled, then, in the courts?</p>
<p class="indent">This general question can have only a general answer. The Supreme Court of Oregon has emphasized the difference between statutory and Restatement texts:<b><sup>2</sup></b></p>
<p class="block_noindent">Although this court frequently quotes sections of the Restatements of the American Law Institute, it does not literally &#8220;adopt&#8221; them in the manner of a legislature enacting, for instance, a draft prepared by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, such as the Residen- tial Landlord and Tenant Act. In the nature of common law, such quotations in opinions are no more than shorthand expressions of the court&#8217;s view that the analysis summarized in the Restatement corresponds to Oregon law applicable to the facts of the case before the court. They do not enact the exact phrasing of the Restatement rule, complete with comments, illustrations, and caveats. Such quotations should not be relied on in briefs as if they committed his court or lower courts to track every detail of the Restatement analysis in other cases. The Restatements themselves purport to be just that, &#8220;restatements&#8221; of law found in other sources, although at times they candidly report that the law is in flux and offer a formula preferred on policy grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">There is agreement among those who applaud the Restatement and those who deprecate it about the persuasiveness of an ideal restatement of the law. &#8220;A restatement, then, can have no other authority than as the product of men learned in the subject who have studied and deliberated over it. It needs no other, and what could be higher?&#8221; Clark, op. cit. supra, p. 655. Judge Herbert Goodrich, for many years Director of the Institute, explained:</p>
<p class="block_noindent">If an advocate thinks the Restatement was wrong as applied to his case, he can urge the court not to follow it, but to apply some other rule. If the court agrees, it will do so, but it will so do with <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the knowledge that the rule which it rejects has been written by the people who by training and reputation are supposed to be emi- nently learned in the particular subject and that the specialist&#8217;s conclusions have been discussed and defended before a body of very able critics. The presumption is in favor of the Restatement. &#8230; Yet it can be overthrown and that fact leaves Restatement acceptance to persuasion. It is common law &#8220;persuasive authority&#8221; with a high degree of persuasion.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>1</sup></b> On occasion a legislature has given statutory backing to the Restatement. The Virgin Islands Code (Title 1, &#167; 4) provides: &#8220;The rules of the common law, as expressed in the restatements of the law approved by the American Law Institute &#8230;, shall be the rules of decision &#8230; in cases to which they apply, in the absence of local laws to the contrary.&#8221; Note, however, that this provision has been held to have been implicitly repealed by subsequent legislation. See Government of the Virgin Islands v. Conner, 60 V.I. 597 (2014).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Restatement Second.</i> To a substantial extent the Restatement Sec- ond reflects the thought of two men in particular: Professor Arthur Corbin and Professor Karl Llewellyn, who shared an attitude toward law some- times described as &#8220;legal realism.&#8221;<b><sup>3</sup></b> Professor Corbin prepared a critical review of the original Restatement, which &#8220;has been the basis for much of the work on the revision.&#8221;<b><sup>4</sup></b> He served also as consultant for the Restate- ment, Second, in its early stages. Professor Llewellyn&#8217;s efforts affected the revision less directly, largely through the impact of his contributions to the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
<p class="indent">In restating the law of contracts for the second half of the twentieth century, an obvious difficulty arose from the fact that large tracts of the subject had recently been occupied by legislation such as the Code and, to a lesser extent, consumer-protection statutes. Indeed, the worth of the enterprise was questioned on the ground of an apparently diminishing importance of common law doctrine. In response, Professor Braucher made this claim:</p>
<p class="indent">The effort to restate the law of contracts in modern terms high- lights the reliance of private autonomy in an era of expanding gov- ernment activity. &#8230; Freedom of contract, refined and redefined in response to social change, has power as it always had.<b><sup>5</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent">A continuing theme of controversy about the Restatements is the wis- dom or unwisdom of departing from rules derived from existing prece- dents, in the interest of a more just and more convenient regime of law. Professor Herbert Wechsler, when Director of the Institute, proposed &#8220;a working formula&#8221; that received the unanimous approval of the Council: &#8220;we should feel obliged in our deliberations to give weight to all of the con- siderations that the courts, under a proper view of the judicial function, deem it right to weigh in theirs.&#8221;<b><sup>6</sup></b> An example of creative restating from <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the first Restatement of Contracts was the formulation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, in section 90.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1. Contract Defined</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2. Promise; Promisor; Promisee; Beneficiary</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A promise is a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understand- ing that a commitment has been made.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The person manifesting the intention is the promisor.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The person to whom the manifestation is addressed is the prom- isee.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Where performance will benefit a person other than the promisee, that person is a beneficiary.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 3. Agreement Defined; Bargain Defined</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons. A bargain is an agreement to exchange promises or to ex- change a promise for a performance or to exchange performances.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 4. How a Promise May Be Made</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A promise may be stated in words either oral or written, or may be in- ferred wholly or partly from conduct.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 5. Terms of Promise, Agreement, or Contract</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A term of a promise or agreement is that portion of the intention or assent manifested which relates to a particular matter.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A term of a contract is that portion of the legal relations resulting from the promise or set of promises which relates to a particular matter, whether or not the parties manifest an intention to create those relations.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 6. Formal Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The following types of contracts are subject in some respects to special rules that depend on their formal characteristics and differ from those governing contracts in general:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) Contracts under seal,</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) Recognizances,</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) Negotiable instruments and documents,</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) Letters of credit.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 7. Voidable Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A voidable contract is one where one or more parties have the power, by a manifestation of election to do so, to avoid the legal relations created by the contract, or by ratification of the contract to extinguish the power of avoidance.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 8. Unenforceable Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An unenforceable contract is one for the breach of which neither the rem- edy of damages nor the remedy of specific performance is available, but which is recognized in some other way as creating a duty of performance, though there has been no ratification.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>CHAPTER 2. FORMATION OF CONTRACTS&#8212;PARTIES AND CAPACITY</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 9. Parties Required</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There must be at least two parties to a contract, a promisor and a prom- isee, but there may be any greater number.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 10. Multiple Promisors and Promisees of the Same Performance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where there are more promisors than one in a contract, some or all of them may promise the same performance, whether or not there are also promises of separate performances.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where there are more promisees than one in a contract, a promise may be made to some or all of them as a unit, whether or not the same or another performance is separately promised to one or more of them.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 11. When a Person May Be Both Promisor and Promisee</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract may be formed between two or more persons acting as a unit and one or more but fewer than all of these persons, acting either singly or with other persons.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 12. Capacity to Contract</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) No one can be bound by contract who has not legal capacity to incur at least voidable contractual duties. Capacity to contract may be partial and its existence in respect of a particular transaction may de- pend upon the nature of the transaction or upon other circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A natural person who manifests assent to a transaction has full legal capacity to incur contractual duties thereby unless he is</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) under guardianship, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) an infant, or</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(c) mentally ill or defective, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) intoxicated.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 13. Persons Affected by Guardianship</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person has no capacity to incur contractual duties if his property is un- der guardianship by reason of an adjudication of mental illness or defect.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 14. Infants</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless a statute provides otherwise, a natural person has the capacity to incur only voidable contractual duties until the beginning of the day before the person&#8217;s eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 15. Mental Illness or Defect</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness or defect</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) he is unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of the transaction, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the contract is made on fair terms and the other party is without knowledge of the mental illness or defect, the power of avoidance under Subsection (1) terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be unjust. In such a case a court may grant relief on such equitable terms as justice requires.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 16. Intoxicated Persons</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a trans- action if the other party has reason to know that by reason of intoxication</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) he is unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of the transaction, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction.</p>
<p class="head2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>CHAPTER 3. FORMATION OF CONTRACTS&#8212;MUTUAL ASSENT</b></p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. IN GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 17. Requirement of a Bargain</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), the formation of a contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Whether or not there is a bargain a contract may be formed under special rules applicable to formal contracts or under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;94.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 2. MANIFESTATION OF ASSENT IN GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 18. Manifestation of Mutual Assent</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange requires that each party either make a promise or begin or render a performance.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 19. Conduct as Manifestation of Assent</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The manifestation of assent may be made wholly or partly by written or spoken words or by other acts or by failure to act.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The conduct of a party is not effective as a manifestation of his as- sent unless he intends to engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The conduct of a party may manifest assent even though he does not in fact assent. In such cases a resulting contract may be voidable be- cause of fraud, duress, mistake, or other invalidating cause.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 20. Effect of Misunderstanding</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) There is no manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning at- tached by the other; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) each party knows or each party has reason to know the mean- ing attached by the other.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The manifestations of the parties are operative in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning attached by the first party; or</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) that party has no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other has reason to know the meaning attached by the first party.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>&#8230; b. The need for interpretation.</i> The meaning given to words or other conduct depends to a varying extent on the context and on the prior experience of the parties. Almost never are all the connotations of a bargain exactly iden- tical for both parties; it is enough that there is a core of common meaning suf- ficient to determine their performances with reasonable certainty or to give a reasonably certain basis for an ap- propriate legal remedy. See &#167; 33. But material differences of meaning are a standard cause of contract disputes, and the decision of such disputes nec- essarily requires interpretation of the language and other conduct of the par- ties in the light of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Interpretation and agreement.</i> There is a problem of interpretation in determining whether a contract has been made as well as in determining what obligations a contract imposes. Where one party makes a precise and detailed offer and the other accepts it, or where both parties sign the same written agreement, there may be an &#8220;integrated&#8221; agreement (see &#167; 209) and the problem is then one of interpret- ing the offer or written agreement. In other cases agreement may be found in a jumble of letters, telegrams, acts and spoken words. In either type of case, the parties may have different understand- ings, intentions and meanings. Even though the parties manifest mutual as- sent to the same words of agreement, there may be no contract because of a material difference of understanding as to the terms of the exchange. Where there is no integration, the parties may also differ as to whether there was an offer of any kind, or whether there was an acceptance. Rules of interpretation governing various situations are stated in Chapter 9 on the scope of contractu- al obligations; those rules are applica- ble in the determination of what each party &#8220;knows or has reason to know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 21. Intention to Be Legally Bound</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Neither real nor apparent intention that a promise be legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract, but a manifestation of intention that a promise shall not affect legal relations may prevent the formation of a contract.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>&#8230; c. Social engagements and domestic arrangements.</i> In some situa- tions the normal understanding is that no legal obligation arises, and some un- usual manifestation of intention is nec- essary to create a contract. Traditional examples are social engagements and agreements within a family group. See &#167;&#167; 189&#8211;91. Where the family relation is not close, valuable services rendered in the home may make binding an express or implied promise to pay for the services; but even in such cases it would often be understood that there is no legal obligation while the agreement is entirely executory on both sides. See Comment a to &#167; 19, Comment b to &#167; 32.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 22. Mode of Assent: Offer and Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange ordinarily takes the form of an offer or proposal by one party followed by an accep- tance by the other party or parties.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A manifestation of mutual assent may be made even though nei- ther offer nor acceptance can be identified and even though the moment of formation cannot be determined.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 23. Necessity That Manifestations Have Reference to Each Other</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is essential to a bargain that each party manifest assent with reference to the manifestation of the other.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 3. MAKING OF OFFERS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 24. Offer Defined</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Offer as promise.</i> An offer may propose an executed sale or barter rather than a contract, or it may pro- pose the exchange of a promise for a performance or an exchange of promis- es, or it may propose two or more such transactions in combination or in the alternative. In the normal case of an offer of an exchange of promises, or in the case of an offer of a promise for an act, the offer itself is a promise, revocable until accepted. There may also be an offer of a performance, to be exchanged either for a return promise (&#167; 55) or for a return performance; in such cases the offer is not necessarily a promise, but there are often warranties or other in- cidental promises.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 25. Option Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An option contract is a promise which meets the requirements for the formation of a contract and limits the promisor&#8217;s power to revoke an offer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 26. Preliminary Negotiations</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has made a further manifestation of assent.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 27. Existence of Contract Where Written Memorial Is Contemplated</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the fact that the par- ties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are pre- liminary negotiations.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 28. Auctions</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) At an auction, unless a contrary intention is manifested,</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the auctioneer invites offers from successive bidders which he may accept or reject;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) when goods are put up without reserve, the auctioneer makes an offer to sell at any price bid by the highest bidder, and after the auctioneer calls for bids the goods cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) whether or not the auction is without reserve, a bidder may withdraw his bid until the auctioneer&#8217;s announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder&#8217;s retraction does not revive any previous bid.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless a contrary intention is manifested, bids at an auction em- body terms made known by advertisement, posting or other publication of which bidders are or should be aware, as modified by any announcement made by the auctioneer when the goods are put up.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 29. To Whom an Offer Is Addressed</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The manifested intention of the offeror determines the person or persons in whom is created a power of acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offer may create a power of acceptance in a specified person or in one or more of a specified group or class of persons, acting separately or together, or in anyone or everyone who makes a specified promise or renders a specified performance.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 30. Form of Acceptance Invited</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer may invite or require acceptance to be made by an affir- mative answer in words, or by performing or refraining from performing a specified act, or may empower the offeree to make a selection of terms in his acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless otherwise indicated by the language or the circumstances, an offer invites acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 31. Offer Proposing a Single Contract or a Number of Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offer may propose the formation of a single contract by a single accep- tance or the formation of a number of contracts by successive acceptances from time to time.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 32. Invitation of Promise or Performance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 33. Certainty</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Even though a manifestation of intention is intended to be under- stood as an offer, it cannot be accepted so as to form a contract unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appro- priate remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The fact that one or more terms of a proposed bargain are left open or uncertain may show that a manifestation of intention is not in- tended to be understood as an offer or as an acceptance.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 34. Certainty and Choice of Terms; Effect of Performance or Reliance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The terms of a contract may be reasonably certain even though it empowers one or both parties to make a selection of terms in the course of performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Part performance under an agreement may remove uncertainty and establish that a contract enforceable as a bargain has been formed.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Action in reliance on an agreement may make a contractual rem- edy appropriate even though uncertainty is not removed.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 4. DURATION OF THE OFFEREE&#8217;S POWER OF ACCEPTANCE</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 35. The Offeree&#8217;s Power of Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer gives to the offeree a continuing power to complete the manifestation of mutual assent by acceptance of the offer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contract cannot be created by acceptance of an offer after the power of acceptance has been terminated in one of the ways listed in &#167; 36.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 36. Methods of Termination of the Power of Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance may be terminated by</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) rejection or counter-offer by the offeree, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) lapse of time, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) revocation by the offeror, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) In addition, an offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated by the non-occurrence of any condition of acceptance under the terms of the of- fer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 37. Termination of Power of Acceptance Under Option Contract</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding &#167;&#167; 38&#8211;49, the power of acceptance under an option con- tract is not terminated by rejection or counter-offer, by revocation, or by death or incapacity of the offeror, unless the requirements are met for the discharge of a contractual duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 38. Rejection</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated by his rejection of the offer, unless the offeror has manifested a contrary intention.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A manifestation of intention not to accept an offer is a rejection unless the offeree manifests an intention to take it under further advise- ment.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 39. Counter-Offers</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A counter-offer is an offer made by an offeree to his offeror relat- ing to the same matter as the original offer and proposing a substituted bargain differing from that proposed by the original offer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated by his making of a counter-offer, unless the offeror has manifested a contrary intention or unless the counter-offer manifests a contrary intention of the offeree.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 40. Time When Rejection or Counter-Offer Terminates the Power of Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Rejection or counter-offer by mail or telegram does not terminate the power of acceptance until received by the offeror, but limits the power so that a letter or telegram of acceptance started after the sending of an otherwise effective rejection or counter-offer is only a counter-offer unless the acceptance is received by the offeror before he receives the rejection or counter-offer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 41. Lapse of Time</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated at the time speci- fied in the offer, or, if no time is specified, at the end of a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) What is a reasonable time is a question of fact, depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted acceptance are made.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Unless otherwise indicated by the language or the circumstances, and subject to the rule stated in &#167; 49, an offer sent by mail is seasonably <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>accepted if an acceptance is mailed at any time before midnight on the day on which the offer is received.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 42. Revocation by Communication From Offeror Received by Offeree</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated when the offeree receives from the offeror a manifestation of an intention not to enter into the pro- posed contract.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 43. Indirect Communication of Revocation</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated when the offeror takes definite action inconsistent with an intention to enter into the proposed contract and the offeree acquires reliable information to that effect.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 44. Effect of Deposit on Revocability of Offer</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offeror&#8217;s power of revocation is not limited by the deposit of money or other property to be forfeited in the event of revocation, but the deposit may be forfeited to the extent that it is not a penalty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 45. Option Contract Created by Part Performance or Tender</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a perfor- mance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, an option contract is created when the offeree tenders or begins the invited performance or tenders a beginning of it.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The offeror&#8217;s duty of performance under any option contract so created is conditional on completion or tender of the invited performance in accordance with the terms of the offer.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Offer limited to acceptance by performance only.</i> This Section is lim- ited to cases where the offer does not invite a promissory acceptance. Such an offer has often been referred to as an &#8220;offer for a unilateral contract.&#8221; Typical illustrations are found in offers of rewards or prizes and in non-com- mercial arrangements among relatives and friends. See Comment b to &#167; 32. As to analogous cases arising under offers which give the offeree power to accept either by performing or by promising to perform, as he chooses, see &#167;&#167; 32, 62.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Manifestation of contrary in- tention.</i> The rule of this Section is de- signed to protect the offeree in justifi- able reliance on the offeror&#8217;s promise, and the rule yields to a manifestation of intention which makes reliance un- justified. A reservation of power to revoke after performance has begun means that as yet there is no promise and no offer. See &#167;&#167; 2, 24. In particu- lar, if the performance is one which re- quires the cooperation of both parties, such as the payment of money or the manual delivery of goods, a person who reserves the right to refuse to receive the performance has not made an offer. See &#167; 26.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. B owes A $5000 payable in installments over a five-year peri- od. A proposes that B discharge the debt by paying $4,500 cash within one month, but reserves the right <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to refuse any such payment. A has not made an offer. A tender by B in accordance with the proposal is an offer by B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A, an insurance company, issues a bulletin to its agents, en- titled &#8220;Extra Earnings Agreement,&#8221; providing for annual bonus pay- ments to the agents varying accord- ing to &#8220;monthly premiums in force&#8221; and &#8220;lapse ratio,&#8221; but reserving the right to change or discontinue the bonus, individually or collectively, with or without notice, at any time before payment. There is no offer or promise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Tender of performance.</i> A pro- posal to receive a payment of money or a delivery of goods is an offer only if ac- ceptance can be completed without fur- ther cooperation by the offeror. If there is an offer, it follows that acceptance must be complete at the latest when performance is tendered. A tender of performance, so bargained for and giv- en in exchange for the offer, ordinarily furnishes consideration and creates a contract. See &#167;&#167; 17, 71, 72.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This is so whether or not the tender carries with it any incidental promis- es. See &#167;&#167; 54, 62. If no commitment is made by the offeree, the contract is an option contract. See &#167; 25.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Beginning to perform.</i> If the invited performance takes time, the in- vitation to perform necessarily includes an invitation to begin performance. In most such cases the beginning of per- formance carries with it an express or implied promise to complete perfor- mance. See &#167; 62. In the less common case where the offer does not contem- plate or invite a promise by the offeree, the beginning of performance never- theless completes the manifestation of mutual assent and furnishes consider- ation for an option contract. See &#167; 25. If the beginning of performance requires the cooperation of the offeror, tender of part performance has the same effect. Part performance or tender may also create an option contract in a situation where the offeree is invited to take up the option by making a promise, if the offer invites a preliminary performance before the time for the offeree&#8217;s final commitment.</p>

B gives up her home, moves to A&#8217;s farm, and begins caring for A. A is bound by an option contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A offers to sell a piece of land to B, and promises that if B incurs expense in employing ex- perts to appraise the property the offer will be irrevocable for 30 days. B hires experts and pays for their transportation to the land. A is bound by an option contract.</p>

In January A, an employ- er, publishes a notice to his employ- ees, promising a stated Christmas bonus to any employee who is con- tinuously in A&#8217;s employ from Janu- ary to Christmas. B, an employee hired by the week, reads the notice and continues at work beyond the expiration of the current week. A is bound by an option contract, and if B is continuously in A&#8217;s employ un- til Christmas a notice of revocation of the bonus is ineffective.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Completion of performance.</i> Where part performance or tender by the offeree creates an option con- tract, the offeree is not bound to com- plete performance. The offeror alone is bound, but his duty of performance is conditional on completion of the offer- ee&#8217;s performance. If the offeree aban- dons performance, the offeror&#8217;s duty to perform never arises. See &#167; 224, defining &#8220;condition,&#8221; and Illustration 4 to that Section. But the condition may be excused, for example, if the offeror prevents performance, waives it, or re- pudiates. See Comment b to &#167; 225 and &#167;&#167; 239, 278.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Preparations for performance.</i> What is begun or tendered must be part of the actual performance invited in order to preclude revocation under this Section. Beginning preparations, though they may be essential to carry- ing out the contract or to accepting the offer, is not enough. Preparations to perform may, however, constitute jus- tifiable reliance sufficient to make the offeror&#8217;s promise binding under &#167; 87(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In many cases what is invited de- pends on what is a reasonable mode of acceptance. See &#167; 30. The distinction between preparing for performance and beginning performance in such cases may turn on many factors: the extent to which the offeree&#8217;s conduct is clearly referable to the offer, the definite and substantial character of that conduct, and the extent to which it is of actual or prospective benefit to the offeror rather than the offeree, as well as the terms of the communications between the par- ties, their prior course of dealing, and any relevant usages of trade.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Agency contracts.</i> This Section frequently applies to agency arrange- ments, particularly offers made to real estate brokers. Sometimes there is a return promise by the agent, particu- larly if there is an agreement for exclu- sive dealing, since such an agreement normally imposes an obligation on the agent to use best efforts. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;306(2); compare Restatement, Second, Agency &#167; 378. In other cases the agent does not promise to act, but the principal must compen- sate him if he does act. The rules gov- erning the principal&#8217;s duty of compen- sation are stated in detail in Chapter 14 of the Restatement, Second, Agency, particularly &#167;&#167; 443&#8211;57.</p>

<p class="noindent">Where an offer is made by advertisement in a newspaper or other gen- eral notification to the public or to a number of persons whose identity is unknown to the offeror, the offeree&#8217;s power of acceptance is terminated when a notice of termination is given publicity by advertisement or other general notification equal to that given to the offer and no better means of notification is reasonably available.</p>

<p class="noindent">An offer contemplating a series of independent contracts by separate ac- ceptances may be effectively revoked so as to terminate the power to cre- ate future contracts, though one or more of the proposed contracts have already been formed by the offeree&#8217;s acceptance.</p>

<p class="noindent">If communication of an offer to the offeree is delayed, the period within which a contract can be created by acceptance is not thereby extended if the offeree knows or has reason to know of the delay, though it is due to the fault of the offeror; but if the delay is due to the fault of the offeror or to the means of transmission adopted by him, and the offeree neither knows nor has reason to know that there has been delay, a contract can be created by acceptance within the period which would have been per- missible if the offer had been dispatched at the time that its arrival seems to indicate.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 50. Acceptance of Offer Defined; Acceptance by Performance;</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Acceptance by Promise</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Acceptance of an offer is a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Acceptance by performance requires that at least part of what the offer requests be performed or tendered and includes acceptance by a performance which operates as a return promise.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Acceptance by a promise requires that the offeree complete every act essential to the making of the promise.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 51. Effect of Part Performance Without Knowledge of Offer</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless the offeror manifests a contrary intention, an offeree who learns of an offer after he has rendered part of the performance requested by the offer may accept by completing the requested performance.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 52. Who May Accept an Offer</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An offer can be accepted only by a person whom it invites to furnish the consideration.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 53. Acceptance by Performance; Manifestation of Intention Not to Accept</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer can be accepted by the rendering of a performance only if the offer invites such an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as stated in &#167; 69, the rendering of a performance does not constitute an acceptance if within a reasonable time the offeree exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror of non-acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where an offer of a promise invites acceptance by performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, the rendering of the invited performance does not constitute an acceptance if before the offeror per- forms his promise the offeree manifests an intention not to accept.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 54. Acceptance by Performance; Necessity of Notification to Offeror</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a perfor- mance, no notification is necessary to make such an acceptance effective unless the offer requests such a notification.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If an offeree who accepts by rendering a performance has reason to know that the offeror has no adequate means of learning of the perfor- mance with reasonable promptness and certainty, the contractual duty of the offeror is discharged unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the offeree exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror of acceptance, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the offeror learns of the performance within a reasonable time, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the offer indicates that notification of acceptance is not re- quired.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 55. Acceptance of Non-Promissory Offers</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Acceptance by promise may create a contract in which the offeror&#8217;s per- formance is completed when the offeree&#8217;s promise is made.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 56. Acceptance by Promise; Necessity of Notification to Offeror</b></p>

<p class="noindent">If an offer prescribes the place, time or manner of acceptance its terms in this respect must be complied with in order to create a contract. If an offer merely suggests a permitted place, time or manner of acceptance, another method of acceptance is not precluded.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 61. Acceptance Which Requests Change of Terms</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An acceptance which requests a change or addition to the terms of the of- fer is not thereby invalidated unless the acceptance is made to depend on an assent to the changed or added terms.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 62. Effect of Performance by Offeree Where Offer Invites Either Performance or Promise</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an offer invites an offeree to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance, the tender or beginning of the invited performance or a tender of a beginning of it is an acceptance by performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Such an acceptance operates as a promise to render complete per- formance.</p>

<p class="noindent">Unless the offer provides otherwise,</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) an acceptance made in a manner and by a medium invited by an offer is operative and completes the manifestation of mutual as- sent as soon as put out of the offeree&#8217;s possession, without regard to whether it ever reaches the offeror; but</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) an acceptance under an option contract is not operative until received by the offeror.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> It is often said that an offeror who makes an offer by mail makes the post office his agent to receive the acceptance, or that the mailing of a letter of acceptance puts it irrevocably out of the offeree&#8217;s con- trol. Under United States postal regu- lations, however, the sender of a letter has long had the power to stop delivery and reclaim the letter. A better expla- nation of the rule that the acceptance <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>takes effect on dispatch is that the of- feree needs a dependable basis for his decision whether to accept. In many legal systems such a basis is provided by a general rule that an offer is irre- vocable unless it provides otherwise. The common law provides such a basis through the rule that a revocation of an offer is ineffective if received after an acceptance has been properly dis- patched. See Comment c to &#167; 42. Accep- tance by telegram is governed in this respect by the same considerations as acceptance by mail. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Revocation of acceptance.</i> The fact that the offeree has power to re- claim his acceptance from the post of- fice or telegraph company does not pre- vent the acceptance from taking effect on dispatch. Nor, in the absence of ad- ditional circumstances, does the actual recapture of the acceptance deprive it of legal effect, though as a practical matter the offeror cannot assert his rights unless he learns of them. An at- tempt to revoke the acceptance by an overtaking communication is similarly ineffective, even though the revocation is received before the acceptance is re- ceived. After mailing an acceptance of a revocable offer, the offeree is not per- mitted to speculate at the offeror&#8217;s ex- pense during the time required for the letter to arrive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A purported revocation of accep- tance may, however, affect the rights of the parties. It may amount to an of- fer to rescind the contract or to a repu- diation of it, or it may bar the offeree by estoppel from enforcing it. In some cases it may be justified as an exercise of a right of stoppage in transit or a demand for assurance of performance. Compare Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;609, 2&#8211;702, 2&#8211;705. Or the con- tract may be voidable for mistake or misrepresentation, &#167;&#167; 151&#8211;54, 164. See particularly the provisions of &#167; 153 on unilateral mistake.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230;7. A mails an offer to B to appoint B A&#8217;s exclusive distributor in a specified area. B duly mails an acceptance. Thereafter B mails a letter which is received by A be- fore the acceptance is received and which rejects the offer and makes a counter-offer. On receiving the rejection and before receiving the acceptance, A executes a contract appointing C as exclusive distribu- tor instead of B. B is estopped to en- force the contract. Compare &#167; 40.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Option contracts.</i> An option contract provides a dependable basis for decision whether to exercise the op- tion, and removes the primary reason for the rule of Subsection (1). Moreover, there is no objection to speculation at the expense of a party who has irrevoca- bly assumed that risk. Option contracts are commonly subject to a definite time limit, and the usual understanding is that the notification that the option has been exercised must be received by the offeror before that time. Whether or not there is such a time limit, in the absence of a contrary provision in the option contract, the offeree takes the risk of loss or delay in the transmission of the acceptance and remains free to revoke the acceptance until it arrives. Similarly, if there is such a mistake on the part of the offeror as justifies the rescission of his unilateral obligation, the right to rescind is not lost merely because a letter of acceptance is posted. See &#167;&#167; 151&#8211;54.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 64. Acceptance By Telephone or Teletype</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Acceptance given by telephone or other medium of substantially instan- taneous two-way communication is governed by the principles applicable to acceptances where the parties are in the presence of each other.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 65. Reasonableness of Medium of Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless circumstances known to the offeree indicate otherwise, a medium of acceptance is reasonable if it is the one used by the offeror or one cus- tomary in similar transactions at the time and place the offer is received.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 66. Acceptance Must Be Properly Dispatched</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An acceptance sent by mail or otherwise from a distance is not operative when dispatched, unless it is properly addressed and such other precau- tions taken as are ordinarily observed to insure safe transmission of simi- lar messages.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 67. Effect of Receipt of Acceptance Improperly Dispatched</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where an acceptance is seasonably dispatched but the offeree uses means of transmission not invited by the offer or fails to exercise reasonable dili- gence to insure safe transmission, it is treated as operative upon dispatch if received within the time in which a properly dispatched acceptance would normally have arrived.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 68. What Constitutes Receipt of Revocation, Rejection, or Acceptance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A written revocation, rejection, or acceptance is received when the writ- ing comes into the possession of the person addressed, or of some person authorized by him to receive it for him, or when it is deposited in some place which he has authorized as the place for this or similar communica- tions to be deposited for him.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 69. Acceptance by Silence or Exercise of Dominion</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an offeree fails to reply to an offer, his silence and inaction operate as an acceptance in the following cases only:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) Where an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with rea- sonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) Where the offeror has stated or given the offeree reason to un- derstand that assent may be manifested by silence or inaction, and the offeree in remaining silent and inactive intends to accept the offer.</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) Where because of previous dealings or otherwise, it is reason- able that the offeree should notify the offeror if he does not intend to accept.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offeree who does any act inconsistent with the offeror&#8217;s own- ership of offered property is bound in accordance with the offered terms unless they are manifestly unreasonable. But if the act is wrongful as against the offeror it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) To constitute consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The performance may consist of</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) an act other than a promise, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) a forbearance, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the creation, modification, or destruction of a legal relation.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The performance or return promise may be given to the promisor or to some other person. It may be given by the promisee or by some other person.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Other meanings of &#8220;consider- ation.&#8221;</i> The word &#8220;consideration&#8221; has often been used with meanings differ- ent from that given here. It is often used merely to express the legal con- clusion that a promise is enforceable. Historically, its primary meaning may have been that the conditions were met under which an action of assumpsit would lie. It was also used as the equiv- alent of the quid pro quo required in an action of debt. A seal, it has been said, &#8220;imports a consideration,&#8221; although the law was clear that no element of bargain was necessary to enforcement of a promise under seal. On the other hand, consideration has sometimes been used to refer to almost any reason asserted for enforcing a promise, even though the reason was insufficient. In this sense we find references to prom- ises &#8220;in consideration of love and affec- tion,&#8221; to &#8220;illegal consideration,&#8221; to &#8220;past consideration,&#8221; and to consideration furnished by reliance on a gratuitous promise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Consideration has also been used to refer to the element of exchange without regard to legal consequences. Consistent with that usage has been the use of the phrase &#8220;sufficient consid- eration&#8221; to express the legal conclusion that one requirement for an enforce- able bargain is met. Here &#167; 17 states the element of exchange required for <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a contract enforceable as a bargain as &#8220;a consideration.&#8221; Thus &#8220;consideration&#8221; refers to an element of exchange which is sufficient to satisfy the legal require- ment; the word &#8220;sufficient&#8221; would be redundant and is not used.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. &#8220;Bargained for.&#8221;</i> In the typi- cal bargain, the consideration and the promise bear a reciprocal relation of motive or inducement: the consider- ation induces the making of the prom- ise and the promise induces the fur- nishing of the consideration. Here, as in the matter of mutual assent, the law is concerned with the external mani- festation rather than the undisclosed mental state: it is enough that one par- ty manifests an intention to induce the other&#8217;s response and to be induced by it and that the other responds in accor- dance with the inducement. See &#167; 81; compare &#167;&#167; 19, 20. But it is not enough that the promise induces the conduct of the promisee or that the conduct of the promisee induces the making of the promise; both elements must be pres- ent, or there is no bargain. Moreover, a mere pretense of bargain does not suf- fice, as where there is a false recital of consideration or where the purported consideration is merely nominal. In such cases there is no consideration and the promise is enforced, if at all, as a promise binding without consider- ation under &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;94. See Comments b and c to &#167; 87.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A offers to buy a book owned by B and to pay B $10 in exchange therefor. B accepts the offer and delivers the book to A. The transfer and delivery of the book constitute a performance and are consideration for A&#8217;s promise. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;106, 2&#8211;301. This is so even though A at the time he makes the offer secretly intends to pay B $10 whether or not he gets the book, or even though B at the time he ac- cepts secretly intends not to collect the $10.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A receives a gift from B of a book worth $10. Subsequently A promises to pay B the value of the book. There is no consideration for A&#8217;s promise. This is so even though B at the time he makes the gift se- cretly hopes that A will pay him for it. As to the enforcement of such promises, see &#167; 86.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A promises to make a gift of $10 to B. In reliance on the prom- ise B buys a book from C and prom- ises to pay C $10 for it. There is no consideration for A&#8217;s promise. As to the enforcement of such promises, see &#167; 90.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A desires to make a bind- ing promise to give $1000 to his son B. Being advised that a gratuitous promise is not binding, A writes out and signs a false recital that B has sold him a car for $1000 and a promise to pay that amount. There is no consideration for A&#8217;s promise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A desires to make a bind- ing promise to give $1000 to his son B. Being advised that a gratuitous promise is not binding, A offers to buy from B for $1000 a book worth less than $1. B accepts the offer knowing that the purchase of the book is a mere pretense. There is no consideration for A&#8217;s promise to pay $1000.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Mixture of bargain and gift.</i> In most commercial bargains there is a rough equivalence between the value promised and the value received as consideration. But the social functions of bargains include the provision of op- portunity for free individual action and exercise of judgment and the fixing of values by private action, either gener- ally or for purposes of the particular transaction. Those functions would be impaired by judicial review of the values so fixed. Ordinarily, therefore, courts do not inquire into the adequacy <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of consideration, particularly where one or both of the values exchanged are difficult to measure. See &#167; 79. Even where both parties know that a trans- action is in part a bargain and in part a gift, the element of bargain may nev- ertheless furnish consideration for the entire transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">On the other hand, a gift is not or- dinarily treated as a bargain, and a promise to make a gift is not made a bargain by the promise of the prospec- tive donee to accept the gift, or by his acceptance of part of it. This may be true even though the terms of gift im- pose a burden on the donee as well as the donor. See Illustration 2 to &#167; 24. In such cases the distinction between bar- gain and gift may be a fine one, depend- ing on the motives manifested by the parties. In some cases there may be no bargain so long as the agreement is en- tirely executory, but performance may furnish consideration or the agreement may become fully or partly enforceable by virtue of the reliance of one party or the unjust enrichment of the other. Compare &#167; 90.</p>

B&#8217;s transfer and delivery of the book are consider- ation for A&#8217;s promise even though both parties know that such books regularly sell for $5 and that part of A&#8217;s motive in making the offer is to make a gift to B. See &#167;&#167; 79, 81.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A owns land worth $10,000 which is subject to a mortgage to secure a debt of $5,000. A promis- es to make a gift of the land to his son B and to pay off the mortgage, and later gives B a deed subject to the mortgage. B&#8217;s acceptance of the deed is not consideration for A&#8217;s promise to pay the mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A and B agree that A will advance $1000 to B as a gratuitous loan. B&#8217;s promise to accept the loan is not consideration for A&#8217;s promise to make it. But the loan when made is consideration for B&#8217;s promise to repay.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Types of consideration.</i> Consid- eration may consist of a performance or of a return promise. Consideration by way of performance may be a specified act of forbearance, or any one of several specified acts or forbearances of which the offeree is given the choice, or such conduct as will produce a specified re- sult. Or either the offeror or the offeree may request as consideration the cre- ation, modification or destruction of a purely intangible legal relation. Not in- frequently the consideration bargained for is an act with the added require- ment that a certain legal result shall be produced. Consideration by way of return promise requires a promise as defined in &#167; 2. Consideration may con- sist partly of promise and partly of oth- er acts or forbearances, and the consid- eration invited may be a performance or a return promise in the alternative. Though a promise is itself an act, it is treated separately from other acts. See &#167; 75.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. The executory exchange.</i> In modern times the enforcement of bar- gains is not limited to those partly com- pleted, but is extended to the wholly executory exchange in which promise is exchanged for promise. In such a case the element of unjust enrichment is not present; the element of reliance, if pres- ent at all, is less tangible and direct than in the case of the half-completed exchange. The promise is enforced by virtue of the fact of bargain, without more. Since the principle that bargains are binding is widely understood and is reinforced in many situations by cus- tom and convention, the fact of bargain also tends to satisfy the cautionary and channeling functions of form. Compare Comments b and c to &#167; 72. Evidentiary safeguards, however, are largely left to the Statute of Frauds rather than to the requirement of consideration. See Chapter 5.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Promise and performance.</i> The principle of this Section is that, in determining whether there is con- sideration, one&#8217;s word is as good as one&#8217;s deed but no better. More detailed rules are stated in &#167;&#167; 76&#8211;78 for cases in which the application of this principle has produced problems. Certain cases which have sometimes been thought to be exceptions to the principle are com- mented upon below.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Performance of legal duty and settlement of claims.</i> A promise to per- form a legal duty is not consideration for a return promise unless perfor- mance would be. Similarly, a promise to surrender a claim or defense or to forbear from asserting it is consider- ation only if performance would be. Thus a promise of such performance may raise the same questions as the performance would: Is the duty owed to the maker of the return promise? Is the claim or defense known to be invalid? See &#167;&#167; 73, 74.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A promises to pay a debt to B, or to perform an existing contrac- tual duty to B, or to perform his duty as a public official. The legal duty is neither doubtful nor the subject of honest dispute, but A would not have fulfilled the duty but for B&#8217;s return promise. A&#8217;s promise is not consideration for B&#8217;s return prom- ise. Compare &#167; 73.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A promises B to surrender or to forbear suit upon a claim either against B or against C. A knows the claim is invalid. A&#8217;s promise is not consideration for a return promise by B. Compare &#167; 74.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. &#8220;Void&#8221; promises.</i> The value of a promise does not necessarily depend upon the availability of a legal rem- edy for breach, and bargains are of- ten made in consideration of promises which are voidable or unenforceable. Such a promise may be consideration for a return promise. See &#167; 78. But it is sometimes suggested that a promise is not consideration if it is not binding, or if it is &#8220;void.&#8221; The examples used com- monly involve total lack of capacity to contract (see &#167;&#167; 12, 13), indefinite prom- ises (see &#167;&#167; 33&#8211;34), promises lacking consideration, or promises unenforce- able as against public policy (see Chap- ter 8). Such cases are not exceptions to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the rule stated in this Section. In some of them there is no promise within the definition in &#167; 2, in others the return promise would not be binding whether the consideration consisted of a prom- ise or of performance, in some the in- validity of the return promise rests on other policies than those embodied in the requirement of consideration.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A promises to forbear suit against B in exchange for B&#8217;s prom- ise to pay a liquidated and undis- puted debt to A. A&#8217;s promise is not binding because B&#8217;s promise is not consideration under &#167; 73, but A&#8217;s promise is nevertheless consideration for B&#8217;s. Moreover, B&#8217;s prom- ise would be enforceable without consideration under &#167; 82. On either basis, B&#8217;s promise is conditional on A&#8217;s forbearance and can be enforced only if the condition is met.</p>

<p class="indent1">(c) &#8220;mutuality of obligation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>&#8230; b. Benefit and detriment.</i> Historically, the common law action of debt was said to require a quid pro quo, and that requirement may have led to statements that consideration must be a benefit to the promisor. But contracts were enforced in the common-law ac- tion of assumpsit without any such requirement; in actions of assumpsit the emphasis was rather on the harm to the promisee, and detrimental reli- ance on a promise may still be the basis of contractual relief. See &#167; 90. But reli- ance is not essential to the formation of a bargain, and remedies for breach have long been given in cases of ex- change of promise for promise where neither party has begun to perform. To- day when it is said that consideration must involve a detriment to the prom- isee, the supposed requirement is often qualified by a statement that a &#8220;legal detriment&#8221; is sufficient even though there is no economic detriment or other actual loss. It is more realistic to say simply that there is no requirement of detriment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Exchange of unequal values.</i> To the extent that the apportionment of productive energy and product in the economy are left to private action, the parties to transactions are free to fix their own valuations. The resolution of disputes often requires a determina- tion of value in the more general sense of market value, and such values are commonly fixed as an approximation based on a multitude of private valu- ations. But in many situations there is no reliable external standard of value, or the general standard is inappropri- ate to the precise circumstances of the parties. Valuation is left to private action in part because the parties are thought to be better able than others to evaluate the circumstances of particu- lar transactions. In any event, they are not ordinarily bound to follow the valu- ations of others.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Ordinarily, therefore, courts do not inquire into the adequacy of consider- ation. This is particularly so when one or both of the values exchanged are un- certain or difficult to measure. But it is also applied even when it is clear that the transaction is a mixture of bargain and gift. See Comment c to &#167; 71. Gross inadequacy of consideration may be rel- evant to issues of capacity, fraud and the like, but the requirement of con- sideration is not a safeguard against imprudent and improvident contracts except in cases where it appears that there is no bargain in fact. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Effects of gross inadequacy.</i> Although the requirement of consider- ation may be met despite a great dif- ference in the values exchanged, gross inadequacy of consideration may be relevant in the application of other rules. Inadequacy &#8220;such as shocks the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>conscience&#8221; is often said to be a &#8220;badge of fraud,&#8221; justifying a denial of specific performance. See &#167; 364(1)(c). Inadequa- cy may also help to justify rescission or cancellation on the ground of lack of capacity (see &#167;&#167; 15, 16), mistake, mis- representation, duress or undue influ- ence (see Chapters 6 and 7). Unequal bargains are also limited by the statu- tory law of usury, by regulation of the rates of public utilities and some other enterprises, and by special rules devel- oped for the sale of an expectation of inheritance, for contractual penalties and forfeitures (see &#167;&#167; 229, 356), and for agreements between secured lender and borrower (see Restatement of Se- curity &#167; 55, Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 9&#8211;501).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Mutuality.</i> The word &#8220;mutual- ity,&#8221; though often used in connection with the law of Contracts, has no definite meaning. &#8220;Mutual assent&#8221; as one element of a bargain is the subject of Topic 2 of this Chapter. &#8220;Mutuality of remedy&#8221; is dealt with in Comment c to &#167; 363. Clause (c) of this Section negates any supposed requirement of &#8220;mutual- ity of obligation.&#8221; Such a requirement has sometimes been asserted in the form, &#8220;Both parties must be bound or neither is bound.&#8221; That statement is obviously erroneous as applied to an exchange of promise for performance; it is equally inapplicable to contracts governed by &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;94 and to contracts enforceable by virtue of their formal characteristics under &#167; 6. Even in the ordinary case of the exchange of prom- ise for promise, &#167; 78 makes it clear that voidable and unenforceable prom- ises may be consideration. The only re- quirement of &#8220;mutuality of obligation&#8221; even in cases of mutual promises is that stated in &#167;&#167; 76&#8211;77.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 80. Multiple Exchanges</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) There is consideration for a set of promises if what is bargained for and given in exchange would have been consideration for each prom- ise in the set if exchanged for that promise alone.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The fact that part of what is bargained for would not have been consideration if that part alone had been bargained for does not prevent the whole from being consideration.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 81. Consideration as Motive or Inducing Cause</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The fact that what is bargained for does not of itself induce the making of a promise does not prevent it from being consideration for the promise.</p>

<p class="indent">(2) If such a promise is made before the time for the occurrence of the condition has expired and the condition is within the control of the prom- isee or a beneficiary, the promisor can make his duty again subject to the condition by notifying the promisee or beneficiary of his intention to do so if</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. &#8220;Past consideration&#8221;; &#8220;moral obligation.&#8221;</i> Enforcement of promises to pay for benefit received has some- times been said to rest on &#8220;past consid- eration&#8221; or on the &#8220;moral obligation&#8221; of the promisor, and there are statutes in such terms in a few states. Those terms are not used here: &#8220;past consideration&#8221; is inconsistent with the meaning of consideration stated in &#167; 71, and there seems to be no consensus as to what constitutes a &#8220;moral obligation.&#8221; The mere fact of promise has been thought to create a moral obligation, but it is clear that not all promises are enforced. Nor are moral obligations based solely on gratitude or sentiment sufficient of themselves to support a subsequent promise.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>

<p class="comment_indent1">3. A has immoral relations with B, a woman not his wife, to her injury. A&#8217;s subsequent promise to reimburse B for her loss is not bind- ing under this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Rationale.</i> Although in gen- eral a person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution, restitu- tion is denied in many cases in order to protect persons who have had benefits thrust upon them. See Restatement of Restitution &#167;&#167; 1, 2, 112. In other cases restitution is denied by virtue of rules designed to guard against false claims, stale claims, claims already litigated, and the like. In many such cases a subsequent promise to make restitu- tion removes the reason for the denial of relief, and the policy against unjust enrichment then prevails. Compare Restatement, Second, Agency &#167; 462 on ratification of the acts of a person who officiously purports to act as an agent. Enforcement of the subsequent prom- ise sometimes makes it unnecessary to decide a difficult question as to the lim- its on quasi-contractual relief.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Many of the cases governed by the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;85 are within the broader principle stated in this Sec- tion. But the broader principle is not so firmly established as those rules, and it may not be applied if there is <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>doubt whether the objections to resti- tution are fully met by the subsequent promise. Facts such as the definite and substantial character of the benefit re- ceived, formality in the making of the promise, part performance of the prom- ise, reliance on the promise or the prob- ability of such reliance may be relevant to show that no imposition results from enforcement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Promise to correct a mistake.</i> One who makes a mistake in the con- ferring of a benefit is commonly en- titled to restitution regardless of any promise. But restitution is often de- nied to avoid prejudice to the recipient of the benefit. Thus restitution of the value of services or of improvements to land or chattels may require a pay- ment which the recipient cannot afford. See Restatement of Restitution &#167;&#167; 41, 42. Where a subsequent promise shows that the usual protection is not needed in the particular case, restitution is granted to the extent promised.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A is employed by B to re- pair a vacant house. By mistake A repairs the house next door, which belongs to C. A subsequent promise by C to pay A the value of the re- pairs is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A pays B a debt and gets a signed receipt. Later B obtains a default judgment against A for the amount of the debt, and A pays again. B&#8217;s subsequent promise to refund the second payment if A has a receipt is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Emergency services and nec- essaries.</i> The law of restitution in the absence of promise severely limits re- covery for necessaries furnished to a person under disability and for emer- gency services. See Restatement of Restitution &#167;&#167; 113&#8211;17, 139. A subse- quent promise in such a case may re- move doubt as to the reality of the ben- efit and as to its value, and may negate any danger of imposition or false claim. A positive showing that payment was expected is not then required; an inten- tion to make a gift must be shown to defeat restitution.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Benefit conferred as a gift.</i> In the absence of mistake or the like, there is no element of unjust enrichment in the receipt of a gift, and the rule of this Section has no application to a promise to pay for a past gift. Similarly, when a debt is discharged by a binding agree- ment, the transaction is closed even though full payment is not made. But marginal cases arise in which both par- ties understand that what is in form a gift is intended to be reimbursed indi- rectly, or in which a subsequent prom- ise to pay is expressly contemplated. See Illustration 3 to &#167; 83. Enforcement of the subsequent promise is proper in some such cases.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Benefit conferred pursuant to contract.</i> By virtue of the policy of enforcing bargains, the enrichment of one party as a result of an unequal ex- change is not regarded as unjust, and this Section has no application to a promise to pay or perform more or to accept less than is called for by a pre- existing bargain between the same parties. Compare &#167;&#167; 79, 89. Similarly, if a third person receives a benefit as a result of the performance of a bargain, this Section does not make binding the subsequent promise of the third person to pay extra compensation to the per- forming party.

Obligation unenforceable un- der the Statute of Frauds.</i> A promise to pay a debt unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds is very similar to the promises governed by &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;85. But the problem seldom arises. Part performance often renders the Statute inapplicable; if it does not, the contract can be made enforceable by a subse- quent memorandum. See &#167; 136. In any event, the Statute does not ordinarily foreclose the remedy of restitution. See &#167; 375. Where the question does arise, the new promise is binding if the policy of the Statute is satisfied.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">11. By statute an agreement authorizing a real estate broker to sell land for compensation is void unless the agreement or a memo- randum thereof is in writing. A, a real estate broker, procures a pur- chaser for B&#8217;s land without any written agreement. In the written sale agreement, signed by B, B promises to pay A $200, the usual commission, &#8220;for services rendered.&#8221; The promise is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Obligation unenforceable be- cause usurious.</i> If a promise is unen- forceable because it is usurious, an agreement in renewal or substitution for it that provides for a payment in- cluding the usurious interest is also unenforceable, even though the inter- est from the date of renewal or sub- stitution is not usurious. However, a promise to pay the original debt with interest that is not usurious in substi- tution for the usurious interest is en- forceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Partial enforcement.</i> The rules stated in &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;85 refer to promises to perform all or part of an antecedent duty, and do not make enforceable a promise to do more. Similarly, where a benefit received is a liquidated sum of money, a promise is not enforceable un- der this Section beyond the amount of the benefit. Where the value of the ben- efit is uncertain, a promise to pay the value is binding and a promise to pay a liquidated sum may serve to fix the amount due if in all the circumstances it is not disproportionate to the benefit. See Illustration 7. A promise which is excessive may sometimes be enforced to the extent of the value of the benefit, and the remedy may be thought of as quasi-contractual rather than contrac- tual. In other cases a promise of dis- proportionate value may tend to show unfair pressure or other conduct by the promisee such that justice does not require <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>any enforcement of the promise.

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 87. Option Contract</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer is binding as an option contract if it</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) is in writing and signed by the offeror, recites a purported con- sideration for the making of the offer, and proposes an exchange on fair terms within a reasonable time; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) is made irrevocable by statute.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect to induce ac- tion or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Consideration and form.</i> The traditional common-law devices for making a firm offer or option contract are the giving of consideration and the affixing of a seal. See &#167;&#167; 25, 95. But the firm offer serves a useful purpose even though no preliminary bargain is made: it is often a necessary step in the making of the main bargain proposed, and it partakes of the natural formali- ties inherent in business transactions. The erosion of the formality of the seal has made it less and less satisfactory as a universal formality. As literacy has spread, the personal signature has become the natural formality and the seal has become more and more anach- ronistic. The rules stated in this sec- tion reflect the judicial and legislative response to this situation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Nominal consideration.</i> Of- fers made in consideration of one dollar paid or promised are often irrevocable under Subsection (1)(a). The irrevoca- bility of an offer may be worth much or little to the offeree, and the courts do not ordinarily inquire into the adequa- cy of the consideration bargained for. See &#167; 79. Hence a comparatively small payment may furnish consideration for the irrevocability of an offer proposing a transaction involving much larger sums. But gross disproportion between the payment and the value of the op- tion commonly indicates that the pay- ment was not in fact bargained for but was a mere formality or pretense. In such a case there is no consideration as that term is defined in &#167; 71.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Nevertheless, such a nominal con- sideration is regularly held sufficient to support a short-time option propos- ing an exchange on fair terms. The fact that the option is an appropriate preliminary step in the conclusion of a socially useful transaction provides a sufficient substantive basis for enforce- ment, and a signed writing taking a <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>form appropriate to a bargain satisfies the desiderata of form. In the absence of statute, however, the bargaining form is essential: a payment of one dol- lar by each party to the other is so obvi- ously not a bargaining transaction that it does not provide even the form of an exchange. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. False recital of nominal con- sideration.</i> A recital in a written agree- ment that a stated consideration has been given is evidence of that fact as against a party to the agreement, but such a recital may ordinarily be con- tradicted by evidence that no such con- sideration was given or expected. See &#167; 218. In cases within Subsection (1) (a), however, the giving and recital of nominal consideration performs a for- mal function only. The signed writing has vital significance as a formality, while the ceremonial manual delivery of a dollar or a peppercorn is an incon- sequential formality. In view of the dangers of permitting a solemn writ- ten agreement to be invalidated by oral testimony which is easily fabricated, therefore, the option agreement is not invalidated by proof that the recited consideration was not in fact given. A fictitious rationalization has some- times been used for this rule: accep- tance of delivery of the written instru- ment conclusively imports a promise to make good the recital, it is said, and that promise furnishes consideration. Compare &#167; 218. But the sound basis for the rule is that stated above. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Reliance.</i> Subsection (2) states the application of &#167; 90 to reliance on an unaccepted offer, with qualifications which would not be appropriate in some other types of cases covered by &#167; 90. It is important chiefly in cases of reliance that is not part performance. If the be- ginning of performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, it makes the offer fully enforceable under &#167; 45 or &#167; 62; if not, the offeror commonly has no rea- son to expect part performance before acceptance. But circumstances may be such that the offeree must undergo substantial expense, or undertake sub- stantial commitments, or forego alter- natives, in order to put himself in a position to accept by either promise or performance. The offer may be made expressly irrevocable in contemplation of reliance by the offeree. If reliance fol- lows in such cases, justice may require a remedy. Compare Restatement, Sec- ond, Torts &#167; 325; Restatement, Second, Agency &#167; 378. But the reliance must be substantial as well as foreseeable. &#8230;</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> This Section relates primarily to adjustments in on-going transactions. Like offers and guaran- ties, such adjustments are ancillary to exchanges and have some of the same presumptive utility. See &#167;&#167; 72, 87, 88. Indeed, paragraph (a) deals with bar- gains which are without consideration only because of the rule that perfor- mance of a legal duty to the promisor is not consideration. See &#167; 73. This Sec- tion is also related to &#167; 84 on waiver of conditions: it may apply to cases in which &#167; 84 is inapplicable because a condition is material to the exchange or risk. As in cases governed by &#167; 84, relation to a bargain tends to satisfy the cautionary and channeling func- tions of legal formalities. See Comment c to &#167; 72. The Statute of Frauds may prevent enforcement in the absence of reliance. See &#167;&#167; 149&#8211;50. Otherwise for- mal requirements are at a minimum.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Performance of legal duty.</i> The rule of &#167; 73 finds its modern justifica- tion in cases of promises made by mis- take or induced by unfair pressure. Its application to cases where those ele- ments are absent has been much criti- cized and is avoided if paragraph (a) of this Section is applicable. The limi- tation to a modification which is &#8220;fair and equitable&#8221; goes beyond absence of coercion and requires an objectively de- monstrable reason for seeking a modifi- cation. Compare Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;209 Comment. The reason for modification must rest in circumstanc- es not &#8220;anticipated&#8221; as part of the con- text in which the contract was made, but a frustrating event may be unan- ticipated for this purpose if it was not adequately covered, even though it was foreseen as a remote possibility. When such a reason is present, the relative financial strength of the parties, the formality with which the modification is made, the extent to which it is per- formed or relied on and other circum- stances may be relevant to show or ne- gate imposition or unfair surprise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The same result called for by para- graph (a) is sometimes reached on the ground that the original contract was &#8220;rescinded&#8221; by mutual agreement and that new promises were then made which furnished consideration for each other. That theory is rejected here be- cause it is fictitious when the &#8220;rescis- sion&#8221; and new agreement are simulta- neous, and because if logically carried out it might uphold unfair and inequi- table modifications.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. By a written contract A agrees to excavate a cellar for B for a stated price. Solid rock is unex- pectedly encountered and A so no- tifies B. A and B then orally agree that A will remove the rock at a unit price which is reasonable but nine times that used in computing the original price, and A completes the job. B is bound to pay the increased amount.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts with B to sup- ply for $300 a laundry chute for a building B has contracted to build for the Government for $150,000. Later A discovers that he made an error as to the type of material to be used and should have bid $1,200. A offers to supply the chute for $1000, eliminating overhead and profit. After ascertaining that other suppliers <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>would charge more, B agrees. The new agreement is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A is employed by B as a de- signer of coats at $90 a week for a year beginning November 1 under a written contract executed Septem- ber 1. A is offered $115 a week by another employer and so informs B. A and B then agree that A will be paid $100 a week and in October ex- ecute a new written contract to that effect, simultaneously tearing up the prior contract. The new contract is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to manufac- ture and sell to B 2,000 steel roofs for corn cribs at $60. Before A be- gins manufacture a threat of a na- tionwide steel strike raises the cost of steel about $10 per roof, and A and B agree orally to increase the price to $70 per roof. A thereafter manufactures and delivers 1700 of the roofs, and B pays for 1,500 of them at the increased price without protest, increasing the selling price of the corn cribs by $10. The new agreement is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contracts to manufac- ture and sell to B 100,000 castings for lawn mowers at 50 cents each. After partial delivery and after B has contracted to sell a substantial number of lawn mowers at a fixed price, A notifies B that increased metal costs require that the price be increased to 75 cents. Substitute castings are available at 55 cents, but only after several months delay. B protests but is forced to agree to the new price to keep its plant in operation. The modification is not binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Statutes.</i> Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 2&#8211;209 dispenses with the requirement of consideration for an agreement modifying a contract for the sale of goods. Under that section the original contract can provide against oral modification, and the require- ments of the Statute of Frauds must be met if the contract as modified is within its provisions; but an ineffective modi- fication can operate as a waiver. The Comment indicates that extortion of a modification without legitimate com- mercial reason is ineffective as a viola- tion of the duty of good faith imposed by the Code. A similar limitation may be applicable under statutes which give effect to a signed writing as a sub- stitute for the seal, or under statutes which give effect to acceptance by the promisee of the modified performance. In some States statutes or constitution- al provisions flatly forbid the payment of extra compensation to Government contractors.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Reliance.</i> Paragraph (c) states the application of &#167; 90 to modification of an executory contract in language adapted from Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;209. Even though the prom- ise is not binding when made, it may become binding in whole or in part by reason of action or forbearance by the promisee or third persons in reliance on it. In some cases the result can be viewed as based either on estoppel to contradict a representation of fact or on reliance on a promise. Ordinarily reliance by the promisee is reasonably foreseeable and makes the modification binding with respect to performance by the promisee under it and any return performance owed by the promisor. But as under &#167; 84 the original terms can be reinstated for the future by reasonable notification received by the promisee unless reinstatement would be unjust in view of a change of position on his part. Compare Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;209(5).</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Relation to other rules.</i> Ob- ligations and remedies based on reli- ance are not peculiar to the law of con- tracts. This Section is often referred to in terms of &#8220;promissory estoppel,&#8221; a phrase suggesting an extension of the doctrine of estoppel. Estoppel prevents a person from showing the truth con- trary to a representation of fact made by him after another has relied on the representation. See Restatement, Sec- ond, Agency &#167; 8B; Restatement, Sec- ond, Torts &#167;&#167; 872, 894. Reliance is also a significant feature of numerous rules in the law of negligence, deceit and res- titution. See, e.g., Restatement, Sec- ond, Agency &#167;&#167; 354, 378; Restatement, Second, Torts &#167;&#167; 323, 537; Restatement of Restitution &#167; 55. In some cases those rules and this Section overlap; in oth- ers they provide analogies useful in de- termining the extent to which enforce- ment is necessary to avoid injustice.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">It is fairly arguable that the enforce- ment of informal contracts in the ac- tion of assumpsit rested historically on justifiable reliance on a promise. Cer- tainly reliance is one of the main bases for enforcement of the half-completed exchange, and the probability of reli- ance lends support to the enforcement of the executory exchange. See Com- ments to &#167;&#167; 72, 75. This Section thus states a basic principle which often renders inquiry unnecessary as to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>precise scope of the policy of enforcing bargains. Sections 87&#8211;89 state particu- lar applications of the same principle to promises ancillary to bargains, and it also applies in a wide variety of non- commercial situations. See, e.g., &#167; 94.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, knowing that B is going to college, promises B that A will give him $5,000 on completion of his course. B goes to college, and bor- rows and spends more than $5,000 for college expenses. When he has nearly completed his course, A no- tifies him of an intention to revoke the promise. A&#8217;s promise is bind- ing and B is entitled to payment on completion of the course without regard to whether his performance was &#8220;bargained for&#8221; under &#167; 71.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Character of reliance pro- tected.</i> The principle of this Section is flexible. The promisor is affected only by reliance which he does or should foresee, and enforcement must be nec- essary to avoid injustice. Satisfaction of the latter requirement may depend on the reasonableness of the promisee&#8217;s reliance, on its definite and substantial character in relation to the remedy sought, on the formality with which the promise is made, on the extent to which the evidentiary, cautionary, de- terrent and channeling functions of form are met by the commercial set- ting or otherwise, and on the extent to which such other policies as the en- forcement of bargains and the preven- tion of unjust enrichment are relevant. Compare Comment to &#167; 72. The force of particular factors varies in different types of cases: thus reliance need not be of substantial character in chari- table subscription cases, but must in cases of firm offers and guaranties. Compare Subsection (2) with &#167;&#167; 87, 88.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A promises B not to fore- close, for a specified time, a mort- gage which A holds on B&#8217;s land. B thereafter makes improvements on the land. A&#8217;s promise is binding and may be enforced by denial of foreclo- sure before the time has elapsed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A sues B in a municipal court for damages for personal inju- ries caused by B&#8217;s negligence. After the one year statute of limitations has run, B requests A to discontin- ue the action and start again in the superior court where the action can be consolidated with other actions against B arising out of the same accident. A does so. B&#8217;s implied promise that no harm to A will re- sult bars B from asserting the stat- ute of limitations as a defense.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A has been employed by B for 40 years. B promises to pay A a pension of $200 per month when A retires. A retires and forbears to work elsewhere for several years while B pays the pension. B&#8217;s prom- ise is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Reliance by third persons.</i> If a promise is made to one party for the benefit of another, it is often foresee- able that the beneficiary will rely on the promise. Enforcement of the prom- ise in such cases rests on the same ba- sis and depends on the same factors as in cases of reliance by the promisee. Justifiable reliance by third persons who are not beneficiaries is less likely, but may sometimes reinforce the claim of the promisee or beneficiary.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A holds a mortgage on B&#8217;s land. To enable B to obtain a loan, A promises B in writing to release part of the land from the mortgage upon payment of a stated sum. As A contemplated, C lends money to B on a second mortgage, relying on A&#8217;s promise. The promise is binding and may be enforced by C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A executes and delivers a promissory note to B, a bank, to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>give B a false appearance of assets, deceive the banking authorities, and enable the bank to continue to operate. After several years B fails and is taken over by C, a represen- tative of B&#8217;s creditors. A&#8217;s note is en- forceable by C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A and B, husband and wife, are tenants by the entirety of a tract of land. They make an oral promise to B&#8217;s niece C to give her the tract. B, C and C&#8217;s husband expend mon- ey in building a house on the tract and C and her husband take posses- sion and live there for several years until B dies. The expenditures by B and by C&#8217;s husband are treated like those by C in determining whether justice requires enforcement of the promise against A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Partial enforcement.</i> A prom- ise binding under this section is a con- tract, and full-scale enforcement by normal remedies is often appropriate. But the same factors which bear on whether any relief should be granted also bear on the character and extent of the remedy. In particular, relief may sometimes be limited to restitution or to damages or specific relief measured by the extent of the promisee&#8217;s reliance rather than by the terms of the prom- ise. See &#167;&#167; 84, 89; compare Restate- ment, Second, Torts &#167; 549 on damages for fraud. Unless there is unjust enrich- ment of the promisor, damages should not put the promisee in a better posi- tion than performance of the promise would have put him. See &#167;&#167; 344, 349. In the case of a promise to make a gift it would rarely be proper to award con- sequential damages which would place a greater burden on the promisor than performance would have imposed.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">8. A applies to B, a distribu- tor of radios manufactured by C, for a &#8220;dealer franchise&#8221; to sell C&#8217;s prod- ucts. Such franchises are revocable at will. B erroneously informs A that C has accepted the application and will soon award the franchise, that A can proceed to employ sales- men and solicit orders, and that A will receive an initial delivery of at least 30 radios. A expends $1,150 in preparing to do business, but does not receive the franchise or any ra- dios. B is liable to A for the $1,150 but not for the lost profit on 30 radi- os. Compare Restatement, Second, Agency &#167; 329.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 8, B gives A the erroneous information delib- erately and with C&#8217;s approval and requires A to buy the assets of a deceased former dealer and thus discharge C&#8217;s &#8220;moral obligation&#8221; to the widow. C is liable to A not only for A&#8217;s expenses but also for the lost profit on 30 radios.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. A, who owns and oper- ates a bakery, desires to go into the grocery business. He approaches B, a franchisor of supermarkets. B states to A that for $18,000 B will establish A in a store. B also advis- es A to move to another town and buy a small grocery to gain experi- ence. A does so. Later B advises A to sell the grocery, which A does, taking a capital loss and foregoing expected profits from the summer tourist trade. B also advises A to sell his bakery to raise capital for the supermarket franchise, saying &#8220;Everything is ready to go. Get your money together and we are set.&#8221; A sells the bakery taking a capital loss on this sale as well. Still later, B tells A that considerably more than an $18,000 investment will be needed, and the negotiations be- tween the parties collapse. At the point of collapse many details of the proposed agreement between the parties are unresolved. The assur- ances from B to A are promises on which B reasonably should have ex- pected A to rely, and A is entitled to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>his actual losses on the sales of the bakery and grocery and for his mov- ing and temporary living expenses. Since the proposed agreement was never made, however, A is not en- titled to lost profits from the sale of the grocery or to his expectation interest in the proposed franchise from B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. A is about to buy a house on a hill. Before buying he obtains a promise from B, who owns adjoin- ing land, that B will not build on a particular portion of his lot, where a building would obstruct the view from the house. A then buys the house in reliance on the promise. B&#8217;s promise is binding, but will be specifically enforced only so long as A and his successors do not per- manently terminate the use of the view.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. A promises to make a gift of a tract of land to B, his son-in- law. B takes possession and lives on the land for 17 years, making valu- able improvements. A then dispos- sesses B, and specific performance is denied because the proof of the terms of the promise is not suffi- ciently clear and definite. B is en- titled to a lien on the land for the value of the improvements, not ex- ceeding their cost.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Gratuitous promises to pro- cure insurance.</i> This Section is to be applied with caution to promises to procure insurance. The appropriate remedy for breach of such a promise makes the promisor an insurer, and thus may result in a liability which is very large in relation to the value of the promised service. Often the prom- ise is properly to be construed merely as a promise to use reasonable efforts to procure the insurance, and reliance by the promisee may be unjustified or may be justified only for a short time. Or it may be doubtful whether he did in fact rely. Such difficulties may be re- moved if the proof of the promise and the reliance are clear, or if the promise is made with some formality, or if part performance or a commercial setting or a potential benefit to the promisor pro- vide a substitute for formality.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">13. A, a bank, lends money to B on the security of a mortgage on B&#8217;s new home. The mortgage requires B to insure the property. At the closing of the transaction A promises to arrange for the re- quired insurance, and in reliance on the promise B fails to insure. Six months later the property, still uninsured, is destroyed by fire. The promise is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. A sells an airplane to B, retaining title to secure payment of the price. After the closing A prom- ises to keep the airplane covered by insurance until B can obtain insur- ance. B could obtain insurance in three days but makes no effort to do so, and the airplane is destroyed after six days. A is not subject to li- ability by virtue of the promise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Charitable subscriptions, marriage settlements, and other gifts.</i> One of the functions of the doctrine of consideration is to deny enforcement to a promise to make a gift. Such a prom- ise is ordinarily enforced by virtue of the promisee&#8217;s reliance only if his conduct is foreseeable and reasonable and involves a definite and substan- tial change of position which would not have occurred if the promise had not been made. In some cases, however, other policies reinforce the promisee&#8217;s claim. Thus the promisor might be un- justly enriched if he could reclaim the subject of the promised gift after the promisee has improved it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (2) identifies two other classes of cases in which the promisee&#8217;s claim is similarly reinforced. Ameri- can courts have traditionally favored <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>charitable subscriptions and marriage settlements, and have found consider- ation in many cases where the element of exchange was doubtful or nonexis- tent. Where recovery is rested on reli- ance in such cases, a probability of reli- ance is enough, and no effort is made to sort out mixed motives or to consider whether partial enforcement would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">15. A promises B $5,000, knowing that B desires that sum for the purchase of a parcel of land. Induced thereby, B secures without any payment an option to buy the parcel. A then tells B that he with- draws his promise. A&#8217;s promise is not binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. A orally promises to give her son B a tract of land to live on. As A intended, B gives up a home- stead elsewhere, takes possession of the land, lives there for a year and makes substantial improvements. A&#8217;s promise is binding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. A orally promises to pay B, a university, $100,000 in five an- nual installments for the purposes of its fund-raising campaign then in progress. The promise is confirmed in writing by A&#8217;s agent, and two an- nual installments are paid before A dies. The continuance of the fund- raising campaign by B is sufficient reliance to make the promise bind- ing on A and his estate.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">18. A and B are engaged to be married. In anticipation of the mar- riage A and his father C enter into a formal written agreement by which C promises to leave certain property to A by will. A&#8217;s subsequent mar- riage to B is sufficient reliance to make the promise binding on C and his estate.</p>

<p class="noindent">If a promise within the terms of &#167;&#167; 82&#8211;90 is in terms conditional or per- formable at a future time the promisor is bound thereby, but performance becomes due only upon the occurrence of the condition or upon the arrival of the specified time.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 95. Requirements for Sealed Contract or Written Contract or Instrument</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) In the absence of statute a promise is binding without consider- ation if</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) it is in writing and sealed; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the document containing the promise is delivered; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the promisor and promisee are named in the document or so described as to be capable of identification when it is delivered.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When a statute provides in effect that a written contract or in- strument is binding without consideration or that lack of consideration is an affirmative defense to an action on a written contract or instrument, in order to be subject to the statute a promise must either</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) be expressed in a document signed or otherwise assented to by the promisor and delivered; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) be expressed in a writing or writings to which both promisor and promisee manifest assent.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 96. What Constitutes a Seal</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A seal is a manifestation in tangible and conventional form of an intention that a document be sealed.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A seal may take the form of a piece of wax, a wafer or other sub- stance affixed to the document or of an impression made on the docu- ment.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) By statute or decision in most States in which the seal retains significance a seal may take the form of a written or printed seal, word, scrawl or other sign.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 97. When a Promise Is Sealed</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A written promise is sealed if the promisor affixes or impresses a seal on the document or adopts a seal already thereon.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 98. Adoption of a Seal by Delivery</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless extrinsic circumstances manifest a contrary intention, the deliv- ery of a written promise by the promisor amounts to the adoption of any seal then on the document which has apparent reference to his signature or to the signature of another party to the document.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 99. Adoption of the Same Seal by Several Parties</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Any number of parties to the same instrument may adopt one seal.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 100. Recital of Sealing or Delivery</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A recital of the sealing or of the delivery of a written promise is not es- sential to its validity as a contract under seal and is not conclusive of the fact of sealing or delivery unless a statute makes a recital of sealing the equivalent of a seal.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 101. Delivery</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A written promise, sealed or unsealed, may be delivered by the promisor in escrow, conditionally to the promisee, or unconditionally.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 102. Unconditional Delivery</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A written promise is delivered unconditionally when the promisor puts it out of his possession and manifests an intention that it is to take effect at once according to its terms.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 103. Delivery in Escrow; Conditional Delivery to the Promisee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A written promise is delivered in escrow by the promisor when he puts it into the possession of a person other than the promisee with- out reserving a power of revocation and manifests an intention that the document is to take effect according to its terms upon the occurrence of a stated condition but not otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A written promise is delivered conditionally to the promisee when the promisor puts it into the possession of the promisee without reserving a power of revocation and manifests an intention that the document is to take effect according to its terms upon the occurrence of a stated condi- tion but not otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Delivery of a written promise in escrow or its conditional delivery to the promisee has the same effect as unconditional delivery would have if the requirement of the condition were expressed in the writing.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) In the absence of a statute modifying the significance of a seal, delivery of a sealed promise in escrow or its conditional delivery to the promisee is irrevocable for the time specified by the promisor for the oc- currence of the condition, or, if no time is specified, for a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 104. Acceptance or Disclaimer by the Promisee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Neither acceptance by the promisee nor knowledge by him of the existence of a promise is essential to the formation of a contract by the delivery of a written promise which is binding without consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A promisee who has not manifested assent to a written promise may, within a reasonable time after learning of its existence and terms, render it inoperative by disclaimer.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Acceptance or disclaimer is irrevocable.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 105. Acceptance Where Return Promise Is Contemplated</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a conveyance or a document containing a promise also purports to contain a return promise by the grantee or promisee, acceptance by the grantee or promisee is essential to create any contractual obligation other than an option contract binding on the grantor or promisor.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 106. What Amounts to Acceptance of Instrument</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Acceptance of a conveyance or of a document containing a promise is a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made, either before or after delivery, in accordance with any requirements imposed by the grantor or promisor. If the acceptance occurs before delivery and is not binding as an option contract, it is revocable until the moment of delivery.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 107. Creation of Unsealed Contract by Acceptance by Promisee</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a grantee or promisee accepts a sealed document which purports to contain a return promise by him, he makes the return promise. But if he does not sign or seal the document his promise is not under seal, and whether it is binding depends on the rules governing unsealed contracts.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 108. Requirement of Naming or Describing Promisor and Promisee</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A promise under seal is not binding without consideration unless both the promisor and the promisee are named in the document or so described as to be capable of identification when it is delivered.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 109. Enforcement of a Sealed Contract by Promisee Who Does Not Sign or Seal It</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The promisee of a promise under seal is not precluded from enforcing it as a sealed contract because he has not signed or sealed the document, unless his doing so was a condition of the delivery, whether or not the document contains a promise by him.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 110. Classes of Contracts Covered</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The following classes of contracts are subject to a statute, com- monly called the Statute of Frauds, forbidding enforcement unless there is a written memorandum or an applicable exception:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) a contract of an executor or administrator to answer for a duty of his decedent (the executor-administrator provision);</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) a contract to answer for the duty of another (the suretyship provision);</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) a contract made upon consideration of marriage (the marriage provision);</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) a contract for the sale of an interest in land (the land contract provision);</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) a contract that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof (the one-year provision).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The following classes of contracts, which were traditionally sub- ject to the Statute of Frauds, are now governed by Statute of Frauds pro- visions of the Uniform Commercial Code:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more (Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;201);</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) a contract for the sale of securities (Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 8&#8211;319);</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) a contract for the sale of personal property not otherwise cov- ered, to the extent of enforcement by way of action or defense beyond $5,000 in amount or value of remedy (Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1&#8211;206).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In addition the Uniform Commercial Code requires a writing signed by the debtor for an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest in personal property or fixtures not in the possession of the secured party.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Statutes in most states provide that no acknowledgment or prom- ise is sufficient evidence of a new or continuing contract to take a case out of the operation of a statute of limitations unless made in some writing signed by the party to be charged, but that the statute does not alter the effect of any payment of principal or interest.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) In many states other classes of contracts are subject to a require- ment of a writing.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 111. Contract of Executor or Administrator</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract of an executor or administrator to answer personally for a duty of his decedent is within the Statute of Frauds if a similar contract to answer for the duty of a living person would be within the Statute as a contract to answer for the duty of another.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 2. THE SURETYSHIP PROVISION</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 112. Requirement of Suretyship</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract is not within the Statute of Frauds as a contract to answer for the duty of another unless the promisee is an obligee of the other&#8217;s duty, the promisor is a surety for the other, and the promisee knows or has reason to know of the suretyship relation.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 113. Promises of the Same Performance for the Same Consideration</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where promises of the same performance are made by two persons for a consideration which inures to the benefit of only one of them, the promise of the other is within the Statute of Frauds as a contract to answer for the duty of another, whether or not the promise is in terms conditional on default by the one to whose benefit the consideration inures, unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the other is not a surety for the one to whose benefit the con- sideration inures; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the promises are in terms joint and do not create several du- ties or joint and several duties; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the promisee neither knows nor has reason to know that the consideration does not inure to the benefit of both promisors.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 114. Independent Duty of Promisor</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract to perform or otherwise to satisfy all or part of a duty of a third person to the promisee is not within the Statute of Frauds as a contract to answer for the duty of another if, by the terms of the promise when it is made, performance thereof can involve no more than</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the application of funds or property held by the promisor for the purpose, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) performance of any other duty owing, irrespective of his prom- ise, by the promisor to the promisee, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) performance of a duty which is either owing, irrespective of his promise, by the promisor to the third person, or which the promisee reasonably believes to be so owing.</p>

<p class="noindent">A contract that is itself accepted in satisfaction of a previously existing duty of a third person to the promisee is not within the Statute of Frauds as a contract to answer for the duty of another.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 116. Main Purpose; Advantage to Surety</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A contract that all or part of a duty of a third person to the promisee shall be satisfied is not within the Statute of Frauds as a promise to answer for the duty of another if the consideration for the promise is in fact or apparently desired by the promisor mainly for his own economic advan- tage, rather than in order to benefit the third person. If, however, the consideration is merely a premium for insurance, the contract is within the Statute.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> This Section states what is often called the &#8220;main purpose&#8221; or &#8220;leading object&#8221; rule. Where the surety-promisor&#8217;s main purpose is his own pecuniary or business advantage, the gratuitous or sentimental element often present in suretyship is eliminat- ed, the likelihood of disproportion in the values exchanged between promi- sor and promisee is reduced, and the commercial context commonly provides evidentiary safeguards. Thus there is less need for cautionary or evidentiary formality than in other cases of surety- ship. The situation is comparable to a sale or purchase of a third person&#8217;s ob- ligation, which is also outside the pur- poses of the suretyship provision of the Statute of Frauds. See &#167;&#167; 121, 122. His- torically, the rule could be reconciled with the words of the Statute on the ground that a promisor who received a bargained-for benefit could be sued in debt or indebitatus assumpsit; hence he promised to pay his own debt rath- er than the debt &#8220;of another,&#8221; and the promise was not &#8220;special&#8221; in the sense that special assumpsit was the only appropriate remedy. In modern times, however, the rule is applied in terms of its reason rather than to accord with abandoned procedural categories.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Factors affecting application of the rule.</i> The fact that there is con- sideration for the surety&#8217;s promise is insufficient to bring the rule into play. Slight and indirect possible advantage to the promisor is similarly insuffi- cient. The expected advantage must be such as to justify the conclusion that his main purpose in making the promise is to advance his own inter- ests. Facts such as the following tend to indicate such a main purpose when there is an expected pecuniary or busi- ness advantage: prior default, inability or repudiation of the principal obligor; forbearance of the creditor to enforce a lien on property in which the promisor has an interest or which he intends to use; equivalence between the value of the benefit and the amount promised; lack of participation by the principal obligor in the making of the surety&#8217;s promise; a larger transaction to which the suretyship is incidental. The ben- efit may be supplied to the promisor by the promisee, by the principal obligor, or by some other person; if it is sub- stantial and meets the main purpose test it may come indirectly through benefit to the principal obligor.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. D owes C $1,000. C is about to levy an attachment on D&#8217;s factory. S, who is a friend of D&#8217;s de- siring to prevent his friend&#8217;s finan- cial ruin, orally promises C that if <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>C will forbear to take legal proceed- ings against D for three months S will pay D&#8217;s debt if D fails to do so. S has no purpose to benefit himself and C has no reason to suppose so. S&#8217;s promise is not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. D owes C $1,000. C is about to levy an attachment on D&#8217;s factory. S, who is also a creditor of D&#8217;s, fearing that the attachment will ruin D&#8217;s business and thereby destroy his own chance of collecting his claim, orally promises C that if C will forbear to take legal proceed- ings against D for three months, S will pay D&#8217;s debt if D fails to do so. S&#8217;s promise is enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. D contracts with S to build a house for S. C contracts with D to furnish materials for the purpose. D, in violation of his contract with C, fails to pay C for some of the ma- terials furnished. C justifiably re- fuses to furnish further materials. S orally promises C, that if C will continue to furnish D with materi- als that C had previously agreed to furnish, S will pay the price not only for the materials already furnished but also for the remaining materi- als if D fails to do so. S&#8217;s promise is enforceable.</p>

An official bank examiner threatens to close the bank on ac- count of the impairment of its as- sets because of the loans to D. S, a substantial shareholder of the bank, in consideration of forbear- ance by the examiner, orally prom- ises the bank that if D fails to pay the note, he will do so. The promise of S is enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Insurance premiums.</i> The rule of this Section excludes from the main purpose rule contracts of guaranty insurance whether making such con- tracts is or is not the promisor&#8217;s regular business. Promises of commercial sure- ty companies are practically always in writing. See Restatement of Security &#167; 82 Comment i, defining &#8220;compensat- ed surety.&#8221; An isolated oral guaranty by an individual is within the reason of the Statute if a small fee is paid for guaranty of a much larger debt.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Historical note and modern justifications.</i> This Section restates what is widely known as the &#8220;part per- formance doctrine.&#8221; Part performance is not an accurate designation of such acts as taking possession and making improvements when the contract does not provide for such acts, but such acts regularly bring the doctrine into play. The doctrine is contrary to the words of the Statute of Frauds, but it was estab- lished by English courts of equity soon after the enactment of the Statute. Payment of purchase-money, without more, was once thought sufficient to justify specific enforcement, but a con- trary view now prevails, since in such cases restitution is an adequate reme- dy. English decisions treated a transfer of possession of the land as sufficient, if unequivocally referable to the oral agreement, apparently on the ground that the promise to transfer had been executed by a common-law conveyance. Such decisions are not generally fol- lowed in the United States. Enforce- ment has instead been justified on the ground that repudiation after &#8220;part performance&#8221; amounts to a &#8220;virtual fraud.&#8221; A more accurate statement is that courts with equitable powers are vested by tradition with what in sub- stance is a dispensing power based on the promisee&#8217;s reliance, a discretion to be exercised with caution in the light of all the circumstances. Compare &#167; 90.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Rationale.</i> Two distinct ele- ments enter into the application of the rule of this Section: first, the extent to which the evidentiary function of the statutory formalities is fulfilled by the conduct of the parties; second, the reli- ance of the promisee, providing a com- pelling substantive basis for relief in addition to the expectations created by the promise. The evidentiary element can be satisfied by painstaking exami- nation of the evidence and realistic ap- praisal of the probabilities on the part of the trier of fact; this is commonly summarized in a standard that calls upon the trier of the facts to be satis- fied by &#8220;clear and convincing evidence.&#8221; The substantive element requires con- sideration of the adequacy of the rem- edy of restitution. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Transfer of possession and reasonable reliance.</i> Where specific en- forcement is rested on a transfer of pos- session plus either part payment of the price or the making of improvements, it is commonly said that the action taken by the purchaser must be unequivo- cally referable to the oral agreement. But this requirement is not insisted on if the making of the promise is ad- mitted or is clearly proved. The prom- isee must act in reasonable reliance on the promise, before the promisor has repudiated it, and the action must be such that the remedy of restitution is inadequate. If these requirements are met, neither taking of possession nor payment of money nor the making of improvements is essential. Thus, the rendering of peculiar services not read- ily compensable in money may justify specific performance, particularly if the promisee has also taken other action in reliance on the promise.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 5. THE ONE-YEAR PROVISION</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 130. Contract Not to Be Performed Within a Year</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where any promise in a contract cannot be fully performed within a year from the time the contract is made, all promises in the contract are within the Statute of Frauds until one party to the contract completes his performance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) When one party to a contract has completed his performance, the one-year provision of the Statute does not prevent enforcement of the promises of other parties.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Possibility of performance within one year.</i> The English Statute of Frauds applied to an action &#8220;upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof.&#8221; The design was said to be not to trust to the memory of wit- nesses for a longer time than one year, but the statutory language was not appropriate to carry out that purpose. The result has been a tendency to con- struction narrowing the application of the statute. Under the prevailing interpretation, the enforceability of a contract under the one-year provision does not turn on the actual course of subsequent events, nor on the expecta- tions of the parties as to the probabili- ties. Contracts of uncertain duration are simply excluded; the provision cov- ers only those contracts whose perfor- mance cannot possibly be completed within a year.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">&#8230; 3. A and B, a railway, agree that A will provide grad- ing and ties and B will construct a switch and maintain it as long as A needs it for shipping purposes. A plans to use it for shipping lumber from adjoining land which contains enough lumber to run a mill for 30 years, and uses the switch for 15 years. The contract is not within the one-year provision of the Statute.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A orally promises B to sell him five crops of potatoes to be grown on a specified farm in Minne- sota, and B promises to pay a stated price on delivery. The contract is within the Statute of Frauds. It is impossible in Minnesota for five crops of potatoes to mature in one year.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Discharge within a year.</i> Any contract may be discharged by a sub- sequent agreement of the parties, and performance of many contracts may be excused by supervening events or by the exercise of a power to cancel granted by the contract. The possibil- ity that such a discharge or excuse may occur within a year is not a possibility that the contract will be &#8220;performed&#8221; within a year. This is so even though the excuse is articulated in the agree- ment. This distinction between perfor- mance and excuse for nonperformance is sometimes tenuous; it depends on the terms and the circumstances, par- ticularly on whether the essential pur- poses of the parties will be attained. Discharge by death of the promisor may be the equivalent of performance in case of a promise to forbear, such as a contract not to compete.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 6. SATISFACTION OF THE STATUTE BY A MEMORANDUM</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 131. General Requisites of a Memorandum</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless additional requirements are prescribed by the particular statute, a contract within the Statute of Frauds is enforceable if it is evidenced by any writing, signed by or on behalf of the party to be charged, which</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) reasonably identifies the subject matter of the contract,</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) is sufficient to indicate that a contract with respect thereto has been made between the parties or offered by the signer to the other party, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) states with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the un- performed promises in the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>c. Rationale.</i> The primary purpose of the Statute is evidentiary, to require reliable evidence of the ex- istence and terms of the contract and to prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of contracts never in fact made. The contents of the writing must be such as to make successful fraud un- likely, but the possibility need not be excluded that some other subject mat- ter or person than those intended will also fall within the words of the writ- ing. Where only an evidentiary purpose is served, the requirement of a memo- randum is read in the light of the dis- pute which arises and the admissions of the party to be charged; there is no need for evidence on points not in dis- pute.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The suretyship and marriage provi- sions of the Statute perform a caution- ary as well as an evidentiary function. See &#167;&#167; 112, 124. The land contract pro- vision performs a channeling function. See Statutory Note preceding &#167; 110. Even where these provisions are in- volved, however, there is no evidence of a statutory purpose to facilitate repu- diation of firm oral agreements fairly made, to protect a promisor from temp- tation to perjure himself by false denial of the promise, or to reward a candid contract-breaker by denying enforce- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Types of documents.</i> The stat- utory memorandum may be a written contract, but under the traditional statutory language any writing, formal or informal, may be sufficient, includ- ing a will, a notation on a check, a re- ceipt, a pleading, or an informal letter. Neither delivery nor communication is essential. See &#167; 133. Writing for this purpose includes any intentional re- duction to tangible form. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1&#8211;201. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Subject matter.</i> A memoran- dum, like a contract, must be read in its context and need not be comprehen- sible to persons not familiar with the particular type of transaction. Without reference to executory oral promises, the memorandum in context must in- dicate with reasonable certainty the nature of the transaction and must provide a basis for identifying the land, goods or other subject matter. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Contract between the parties.</i> A memorandum must be sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made between the parties with respect to an identified subject matter or that the signer has offered such a contract to the other party. The parties must be reasonably identified; the identification may consist of a name or initials, even though there may be others with the same name or initials, or of any other reasonably accurate mode of descrip- tion. Identification of the agent of a party in the memorandum sufficiently refers to the party, whether or not the agent is himself a party. See Restate- ment, Second, Agency &#167; 153. Where there is no dispute as to the parties, a party may be sufficiently identified by possession of a memorandum signed by the other party. A signed written of- fer to the public may be sufficient even though the offeree is not identified. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Terms; accuracy.</i> The degree of particularity with which the terms of the contract must be set out cannot be reduced to a formula. The writing must be the agreement or a memorandum &#8220;thereof&#8221;; a memorandum of a different agreement will not suffice. The &#8220;essential&#8221; <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>terms of unperformed promises must be stated; &#8220;details or particulars&#8221; need not. What is essential depends on the agreement and its context and also on the subsequent conduct of the par- ties, including the dispute which arises and the remedy sought. Omission or erroneous statement of an agreed term makes no difference if the same term is supplied by implication or by rule of law. Erroneous statement of a term can sometimes be corrected by reformation. See &#167; 155. Otherwise omission or mis- statement of an essential term means that the memorandum is insufficient. Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;201, however, states a different rule for sale of goods.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 132. Several Writings</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The memorandum may consist of several writings if one of the writings is signed and the writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 133. Memorandum Not Made as Such</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Except in the case of a writing evidencing a contract upon consideration of marriage, the Statute may be satisfied by a signed writing not made as a memorandum of a contract.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 134. Signature</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The signature to a memorandum may be any symbol made or adopted with an intention, actual or apparent, to authenticate the writing as that of the signer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 135. Who Must Sign</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a memorandum of a contract within the Statute is signed by fewer than all parties to the contract and the Statute is not otherwise satisfied, the contract is enforceable against the signers but not against the others.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 136. Time of Memorandum</b></p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 139. Enforcement by Virtue of Action in Reliance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce the action or forbearance is enforceable notwithstand- ing the Statute of Frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach is to be limited as justice requires.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In determining whether injustice can be avoided only by enforce- ment of the promise, the following circumstances are significant:</p>

<p class="indent1">(e) the extent to which the action or forbearance was foreseeable by the promisor.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Relation to other rules.</i> This Section is complementary to &#167; 90, which dispenses with the requirement of consideration if the same conditions are met, but it also applies to promises supported by consideration. Like &#167; 90, this Section overlaps in some cases with rules based on estoppel or fraud; it states a basic principle which some- times renders inquiry unnecessary as to the precise scope of other policies. Sections 128 and 129 state particular applications of the same principle to land contracts; &#167;&#167; 125(3) and 130(2) also rest on it in part. See also Uni- form Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;201(3), 8&#8211;319(b). Where a promise is made without intention to perform, remedies under this Section may be alternative to remedies for fraud. See Comment b to &#167; 313; Restatement, Second, Torts &#167; 530.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Avoidance of injustice.</i> Like &#167; 90 this Section states a flexible prin- ciple, but the requirement of consider- ation is more easily displaced than the requirement of a writing. The reliance must be foreseeable by the promisor, and enforcement must be necessary to avoid injustice. Subsection (2) lists some of the relevant factors in apply- ing the latter requirement. Each factor relates either to the extent to which re- liance furnishes a compelling substan- tive basis for relief in addition to the expectations created by the promise or to the extent to which the circumstanc- es satisfy the evidentiary purpose of the Statute and fulfill any cautionary, deterrent and channeling functions it may serve.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A is lessee of a building for five years at $75 per month and has <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>sublet it for three years at $100 per month. A seeks to induce B to pur- chase the building, and to that end orally promises to assign to B the lease and sublease and to execute a written assignment as soon as B obtains a deed. B purchases the building in reliance on the promise. B is entitled to the rentals from the sublease.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A is a pilot with an estab- lished airline having rights to con- tinued employment, and could take up to six months leave without prej- udice to those rights. He takes such leave to become general manager of B, a small airline which hopes to expand if a certificate to operate over an important route is granted. When his six months leave is about to expire, A demands definite em- ployment because of that fact, and B orally agrees to employ A for two years and on the granting of the certificate to give A an increase in salary and a written contract. In re- liance on this agreement A lets his right to return to his prior employer expire. The certificate is soon grant- ed, but A is discharged in breach of the agreement. The Statute of Frauds does not prevent recovery of damages by A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Particular factors.</i> The force of the factors listed varies in different types of cases, and additional factors may affect particular types of con- tracts. Thus reliance of the kinds usual in suretyship transactions is not suffi- cient to justify enforcement of an oral guaranty, where the evidentiary and cautionary functions performed by the statutory formalities are not fulfilled. See Comment a to &#167; 112. In the case of a contract between prospective spouses made upon consideration of marriage, the policy of the Statute is reinforced by a policy against legal interference in the marriage relation, and reliance incident to the marriage relation does not make the contract enforceable. See Comment d to &#167; 124. Where restitu- tion is an unavailable remedy because to grant it would nullify the statutory purpose, a remedy based on reliance will ordinarily also be denied. See Com- ment a to &#167; 375.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A orally promises to pay B a commission for services in negoti- ating the sale of a business oppor- tunity, and B finds a purchaser to whom A sells the business opportu- nity. A statute extends the Statute of Frauds to such promises, and is interpreted to preclude recovery of the reasonable value of such ser- vices. The promise is not made en- forceable by B&#8217;s reliance on it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Partial enforcement; particu- lar remedies.</i> The same factors which bear on whether any relief should be granted also bear on the character and extent of the remedy. In particular, the remedy of restitution is not ordinar- ily affected by the Statute of Frauds (see &#167; 375); where restitution is an ad- equate remedy, other remedies are not made available by the rule stated in this Section. Again, when specific en- forcement is available under the rule stated in &#167; 129, an ordinary action for damages is commonly less satisfactory, and justice then does not require en- forcement in such an action. See Com- ment c to &#167; 129. In some cases it may be appropriate to measure relief by the extent of the promisee&#8217;s reliance rather than by the terms of the promise. See &#167; 90 Comment e and Illustrations.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 140. Defense of Failure to Perform</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The Statute of Frauds does not invalidate defenses based on the plain- tiff&#8217;s failure to perform a condition of his claim or defenses based on his present or prospective breach of the contract he seeks to enforce.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 141. Action for Value of Performance Under Unenforceable Contract</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) In an action for the value of performance under a contract, except as stated in Subsection (2), the Statute of Frauds does not invalidate any defense which would be available of the contract were enforceable against both parties.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where a party to a contract which is unenforceable against him refuses either to perform the contract or to sign a sufficient memoran- dum, the other party is justified in suspending any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return, and such a suspension is not a defense in an action for the value of performance rendered before the suspension.</p>

<p class="noindent">Where because of the existence of a contract conduct would not be tor- tious, unenforceability of the contract under the Statute of Frauds does not make the conduct tortious if it occurs without notice of repudiation of the contract.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Where a contract to transfer property or a transfer was unenforce- able against the transferor under the Statute of Frauds but subsequently becomes enforceable, the contract or transfer has whatever priority it <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>would have had aside from the Statute of Frauds over an intervening contract by the transferor to transfer the same property to a third person.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the third person obtains title to the property by an enforceable transaction before the prior contract becomes enforceable, the prior con- tract is unenforceable against him and does not affect his title.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 147. Contract Containing Multiple Promises</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where performance of the promises in a contract which subject it to the Statute of Frauds is exclusively beneficial to one party, that party by agreeing to forego the performance may render the remainder of the contract enforceable, but this rule does not apply to a contract to transfer property on the promisor&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the promises in a contract which subject it to the Statute have become enforceable or where the duty to perform them has been discharged by performance or otherwise, the Statute does not prevent enforcement of the remaining promises.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Except as stated in this Section, where some of the unperformed promises in a contract are unenforceable against a party under the Stat- ute of Frauds, all the promises in the contract are unenforceable against him.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) For the purpose of determining whether the Statute of Frauds applies to a contract modifying but not rescinding a prior contract, the second contract is treated as containing the originally agreed terms as modified. The Statute may, however, apply independently of the original terms to a contract to modify a transfer of property.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 151. Mistake Defined</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A mistake is a belief that is not in accord with the facts.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Belief as to facts.</i> In this Re- statement the word &#8220;mistake&#8221; is used to refer to an erroneous belief. A party&#8217;s erroneous belief is therefore said to be a &#8220;mistake&#8221; of that party. The belief need not be an articulated one, and a party may have a belief as to a fact when he merely makes an assumption with respect to it, without being aware of alternatives. The word &#8220;mistake&#8221; is not used here, as it is sometimes used in common speech, to refer to an im- provident act, including the making of a contract, that is the result of such an erroneous belief. This usage is avoided here for the sake of clarity and con- sistency. Furthermore, the erroneous belief must relate to the facts as they exist at the time of the making of the contract. A party&#8217;s prediction or judg- ment as to events to occur in the future, even if erroneous, is not a &#8220;mistake&#8221; as that word is defined here. An errone- ous belief as to the contents or effect of a writing that expresses the agreement is, however, a mistake. Mistake alone, in the sense in which the word is used here, has no legal consequences. The legal consequences of mistake in con- nection with the creation of contractual liability are determined by the rules stated in the rest of this Chapter.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts with B to raise and float B&#8217;s boat which has run aground on a reef. At the time of making the contract, A believes that the sea will remain calm until the work is completed. Several days later, during a sudden storm, the boat slips into deep water and fills with mud, making it more difficult for A to raise it. Although A may have shown poor judgment in mak- ing the contract, there was no mis- take of either A or B, and the rules stated in this Chapter do not apply. Whether A is discharged by super- vening impracticability is governed by the rules stated in Chapter 11. See Illustration 5 to &#167; 261. If, how- ever, the boat had already slipped into deep water at the time the con- tract was made, although they both believed that it was still on the reef, there would have been a mistake of both A and B. Its legal consequenc- es, if any, would be governed by the rule stated in &#167; 152.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to sell and B to buy stock amounting to a con- trolling interest in C Corporation. At the time of making the con- tract, both A and B believe that C Corporation will have earnings of $1,000,000 during the following fis- cal year. Because of a subsequent economic recession, C Corporation earns less than $500,000 during that year. Although B may have shown poor judgment in making the contract, there was no mistake of ei- ther A or B, and the rules stated in this Chapter do not apply. See Uni- form Commercial Code &#167; 8&#8211;306(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Facts include law.</i> The rules stated in this Chapter do not draw the distinction that is sometimes made be- tween &#8220;fact&#8221; and &#8220;law.&#8221; They treat the law in existence at the time of the mak- ing of the contract as part of the total state of facts at that time. A party&#8217;s erroneous belief with respect to the law, as found in statute, regulation, judicial decision, or elsewhere, or with respect to the legal consequences of his acts, may, therefore, come within these rules.</p>

Its legal consequences, if any, are governed by the rule stated in &#167; 152. See Illustration 7 to &#167; 152.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 152. When Mistake of Both Parties Makes a Contract Voidable</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in &#167; 154.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In determining whether the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, account is taken of any relief by way of reformation, restitution, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> Before making a contract, a party ordinarily evaluates the proposed exchange of performances on the basis of a variety of assump- tions with respect to existing facts. Many of these assumptions are shared by the other party, in the sense that the other party is aware that they are made. The mere fact that both parties are mistaken with respect to such an assumption does not, of itself, afford a reason for avoidance of the contract by the adversely affected party. Relief is only appropriate in situations where a mistake of both parties has such a ma- terial effect on the agreed exchange of performances as to upset the very basis for the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This Section applies to such situa- tions. Under it, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party if three conditions are met. First, the mistake must relate to a &#8220;basic assumption on which the contract was made.&#8221; Second, the party seeking avoidance must show that the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performanc- es. Third, the mistake must not be one as to which the party seeking re- lief bears the risk. The parol evidence rule does not preclude the use of prior or contemporaneous agreements or ne- gotiations to establish that the parties were mistaken. See &#167; 214(d). However, since mistakes are the exception rath- er than the rule, the trier of the facts should examine the evidence with par- ticular care when a party attempts to avoid liability by proving mistake. See Comment c to &#167; 155. The rule stated in this Section is subject to that in &#167; 157 on fault of the party seeking relief. It is also subject to the rules on exercise of the power of avoidance stated in &#167;&#167; 378&#8211;85.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Basic assumption.</i> A mistake of both parties does not make the con- tract voidable unless it is one as to a basic assumption on which both parties made the contract. The term &#8220;basic as- sumption&#8221; has the same meaning here as it does in Chapter 11 in connection with impracticability (&#167;&#167; 261, 266(1)) and frustration (&#167;&#167; 265, 266(2)). See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615(a). For example, market conditions and the financial situation of the parties are ordinarily not such assumptions, and, generally, just as shifts in market conditions or financial ability do not <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>effect discharge under the rules gov- erning impracticability, mistakes as to market conditions or financial abil- ity do not justify avoidance under the rules governing mistake. See Comment b to &#167; 261. The parties may have had such a &#8220;basic assumption,&#8221; even though they were not conscious of alternatives. See Introductory Note to Chapter 11. Where, for example, a party purchases an annuity on the life of another per- son, it can be said that it was a basic assumption that the other person was alive at the time, even though the par- ties never consciously addressed them- selves to the possibility that he was dead. See Illustration 6.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land, the value of which has depended mainly on the timber on it. Both A and B believe that the timber is still there, but in fact it has been destroyed by fire. The contract is voidable by B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land, on the basis of the report of a surveyor whom A has employed to determine the acreage. The price is, however, a lump sum not calculated from the acreage. Because of an error in computation by the surveyor, the tract contains ten per cent more acreage than he reports. The contract is voidable by A. Compare Illustrations 8 and 11 to this Section and Illustration 2 to &#167; 158.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land. B agrees to pay A $100,000 in cash and to assume a mortgage that C holds on the tract. Both A and B believe that the amount of the mortgage is $50,000, but in fact it is only $10,000. The contract is voidable by A, unless the court supplies a term under which B is entitled to enforce the contract if he agrees to pay an appropriate additional sum, and B does so. See Illustration 2 to &#167; 158.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy a debt owed by C to A, and secured by a mortgage. Both A and B believe that there is a building on the mortgaged land so that the value of the mortgaged property exceeds that of the debt, but in fact there is none so that its value is less than half that of the debt. The con- tract is voidable by B. See &#167; 333.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contracts to assign to B for $100 a $10,000 debt owed to A by C, who is insolvent. Both A and B believe that the debt is unsecured and is therefore, virtually worth- less, but in fact it is secured by stock worth approximately $5,000. The contract is voidable by A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A pays B, an insurance company, $100,000 for an annuity contract under which B agrees to make quarterly payments to C, who is 50 years old, in a fixed amount for the rest of C&#8217;s life. A and B believe that C is in good health and has a normal life expectancy, but in fact C is dead. The contract is voidable by A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Material effect on agreed ex- change.</i> A party cannot avoid a con- tract merely because both parties were mistaken as to a basic assumption on which it was made. He must, in addi- tion, show that the mistake has a ma- terial effect on the agreed exchange of performances. It is not enough for him to prove that he would not have made the contract had it not been for the mistake. He must show that the result- ing imbalance in the agreed exchange is so severe that he can not fairly be required to carry it out. Ordinarily he will be able to do this by showing that the exchange is not only less desirable to him but is also more advantageous to the other party. Sometimes this is so because the adversely affected party will give, and the other party will receive, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>something more than they sup- posed. Sometimes it is so because the other party will give, and the adversely affected party will receive, something less than they supposed. In such cas- es the materiality of the effect on the agreed exchange will be determined by the overall impact on both parties. In exceptional cases the adversely affect- ed party may be able to show that the effect on the agreed exchange has been material simply on the ground that the exchange has become less desirable for him, even though there has been no ef- fect on the other party. Cases of hard- ship that result in no advantage to the other party are, however, ordinarily appropriately left to the rules on im- practicability and frustration. See Il- lustration 9 and &#167; 266. The standard of materiality here, as elsewhere in this Restatement (e.g., &#167; 237), is a flexible one to be applied in the light of all the circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being as stated in Illustration 3 to &#167; 151, in deter- mining whether the effect on the agreed exchange is material, and the contract therefore voidable by B, the court will consider not only the decrease in its desirability to B but also any advantage to A through his receiving a higher price than the land would have brought on the market had the facts been known. See Illustration 3 to &#167; 151.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land, which they be- lieve contains 100 acres, at a price of $1,000 an acre. In fact the tract contains 110 acres. The contract is not voidable by either A or B, unless additional facts show that the effect on the agreed exchange of perfor- mances is material.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A contracts to sell and B to buy a dredge which B tells A he intends to use for a special and un- usual purpose, but B does not rely on A&#8217;s skill and judgment. A and B believe that the dredge is fit for B&#8217;s purpose, but in fact it is not, al- though it is merchantable. The con- tract is not voidable by B because the effect on the agreed exchange of performances is not material. If B&#8217;s purpose is substantially frustrated, he may have relief under &#167; 266(2). See also Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;314, 2&#8211;315.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Significance of other relief.</i> Under the rule stated in Subsection (2), before determining the effect on the agreed exchange, the court will first take account of any relief that may be available to him or granted to the other party under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 155 (see Illustration 10) and 158 (see Illus- tration 11). A party may choose to seek relief by means of reformation even though it makes his own performance more onerous when, absent reforma- tion, the contract would be voidable by the other party. See Introductory Note and Comment e to &#167; 155.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. A and B agree that A will sell and B will buy a tract of land for $100,000, payable by $50,000 in cash and the assumption of an existing mortgage of $50,000. In reducing the agreement to writ- ing, B&#8217;s lawyer erroneously omits the provision for assumption of the mortgage, and neither A nor B no- tices the omission. Under the rule stated in &#167; 155, at the request of either party, the court will decree that the writing be reformed to add the provision for assumption of the mortgage. The contract is, therefore, not voidable by A because, when ac- count is taken of the availability to him of reformation, the effect on the agreed exchange of performances is not material. See Illustration 1 to &#167; 155.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land, described in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>contract as containing 100 acres, at a price of $100,000, calculated from the acreage at $1,000 an acre. In fact the tract contains only 90 acres. If B is entitled to a reduction in price of $10,000, under the rule stated in &#167; 158(2), the contract is not void- able by B because when account is taken of the availability to him of a reduction in price, the effect on the agreed exchange of performances is not material. See Illustration 1 to &#167; 158. As to the possibility of an argument based on frustration, see &#167; 266(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Allocation of risk.</i> A party may be considered to have undertaken to perform in spite of a mistake that has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances. He then bears the risk of the mistake. Because of the sig- nificance of the allocation of risk in the law of mistake, the scope of this excep- tion is spelled out in detail in &#167; 154. (It is assumed in the illustrations to the present Section that the adversely af- fected party does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in &#167; 154. See, e.g., Illustration 14.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Releases.</i> Releases of claims have afforded particularly fertile ground for the invocation of the rule stated in this Section. It is, of course, a traditional policy of the law to favor compromises as a means of settling claims without resort to litigation. See Comment a to &#167; 74. Nevertheless, a claimant who has executed such a re- lease may later wish to attack it. The situation may arise with respect to any claim, but a particularly common exam- ple involves claims for personal injury, where the claimant may have execut- ed the release without full knowledge of the extent or, perhaps, even of the nature of his injuries. Such a claimant has a variety of possible grounds for at- tacking the release on discovering that his injuries are more serious than he had initially supposed. He may seek to have the release interpreted against the draftsman so as to be inapplicable to the newly discovered injuries (&#167; 206). He may seek to have the release re- formed on the ground that it does not correctly express the prior agreement of the parties (&#167; 155). He may seek to avoid the release on the ground that it was unfairly obtained through misrep- resentation, duress or undue influence (Chapter 7). He may seek to have the release, or at least that part purport- ing to cover the newly discovered inju- ries, held unenforceable as unconscio- nable (&#167; 208). Or he may seek to avoid the release on the ground that both he and the other party were mistaken as to the nature or extent of his injuries. Assuming that the release is properly interpreted to cover unknown injuries and that it was not unfairly obtained or unconscionable, his case will turn on the application of the rule stated in this Section to his claim of mistake. In dealing with such attacks on releases, a court should be particularly sensitive to obscure or misleading language and especially alert to the possibility of un- fairness or unconscionability. Howev- er, the same rules relating to mistake apply to such releases as apply to other contracts, and if the results sometimes seem at variance with those rules, the variance can usually be attributed to the presence of one of the alternative grounds listed above.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A claimant&#8217;s attempt at avoid- ance based on mistake of both parties, therefore, will frequently turn on a de- termination, in the light of all the cir- cumstances, of the basic assumptions of the parties at the time of the release. These circumstances may include the fair amount that would be required to compensate the claimant for his known injuries, the probability that the other party would be held liable on that claim, the amount received by the claimant in settlement of his claim, and the rela- tionship between the known injuries and the newly discovered injuries. If, for example, the amount received by <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the claimant is reasonable in compari- son with the fair amount required to compensate him for his known injuries and the probability of the other party being held liable on that claim, this suggests that the parties assumed that his injuries were only those known. Furthermore, even if the parties do not assume that his injuries are only those known, they may assume that any un- known injuries are of the same general nature as the known ones, while dif- fering in extent. Although the parties may fix the assumptions on which the contract is based by an express provi- sion, fairly bargained for, the common recital that the release covers all inju- ries, known or unknown and of what- ever nature or extent, may be disre- garded as unconscionable if, in view of the circumstances of the parties, their legal representation, and the setting of the negotiations, it flies in the face of what would otherwise be regarded as a basic assumption of the parties. What has been said here with respect to re- leases of claims for personal injury is generally true for releases executed in other contexts.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. A has a claim against B for B&#8217;s admitted negligence, which appears to have caused damage to A&#8217;s automobile in an amount fairly valued at $600. In consideration of B&#8217;s payment of $600, A executes a release of &#8220;all claims for injury to person or property&#8221; that he may have against B. Both A and B be- lieve that A has suffered damage to property only, but A later discovers that he has also suffered personal injuries in the extent of $20,000. The release is voidable by A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. A has a claim against B for B&#8217;s admitted negligence, which ap- pears to have caused personal inju- ries to A&#8217;s back in an amount fairly valued at $10,000, although the parties are aware that A may re- quire further treatment. In consid- eration of B&#8217;s payment of $15,000, A executes a release of &#8220;all claims for injury to person or property&#8221; that he may have against B. A later in- curs additional expenses of $20,000 in connection with his back, which was injured more seriously than he had believed. The release is not voidable by A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Relation to breach of warran- ty.</i> The rule stated in this Section has a close relationship to the rules govern- ing warranties sale by a seller of goods or of other kinds of property. A buyer usually finds it more advantageous to rely on the law of warranty than on the law of mistake. Because of the broad scope of a seller&#8217;s warranties, a buyer is more often entitled to relief based on a claim of breach of warranty than on a claim based on mistake. Furthermore, because relief for breach of warranty is generally based on the value that the property would have had if it had been as warranted (see Uniform Com- mercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;714(2)), it is ordinar- ily more extensive than that afforded if he merely seeks to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake. Neverthe- less, the warranties are not necessar- ily exclusive and, even absent a war- ranty, a buyer may be able to avoid on the ground of mistake if he brings himself within the rule stated in this Section. The effect, on a buyer&#8217;s claim of mistake, of language purporting to disclaim the seller&#8217;s responsibility for the goods is governed by the rules on interpretation stated in Chapter 9.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. A, a violinist, contracts to sell and B, another violinist, to buy a violin. Both A and B believe that the violin is a Stradivarius, but in fact it is a clever imitation.

The con- tract is voidable by B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Mistakes as to different as- sumptions.</i> The rule stated in this Sec- tion applies only where both parties are mistaken as to the same basic as- sumption. Their mistakes need not be, and often they will not be, identical. If, however, the parties are mistaken as to different assumptions, the rule stated in &#167; 153, rather than that stated in this Section, applies.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 153. When Mistake of One Party Makes a Contract Voidable</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him, the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in &#167; 154, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the con- tract would be unconscionable, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Similarity to rule where both are mistaken.</i> In order for a party to have the power to avoid a contract for a mistake that he alone made, he must at least meet the same require- ments that he would have had to meet had both parties been mistaken (&#167; 152). The mistake must be one as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made; it must have a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances; and the mistaken party must not bear the risk of the mistake. The most com- mon sorts of such mistakes occur in bids on construction contracts and re- sult from clerical errors in the compu- tation of the price or in the omission of component items. &#8230; Where only one party is mistaken, however, he must meet either the additional requirement stated in Subparagraph (a) or one of the additional requirements stated in Subparagraph (b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Additional requirement of un- conscionability.</i> Under Subparagraph (a), the mistaken party must in ad- dition show that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable. The reason for this additional requirement is that, if only one party was mistaken, avoidance of the contract will more clearly disappoint the expectations of the other party than if he too was mis- taken. &#8230; The mistaken party bears the substantial burden of establishing unconscionability and must ordinarily show not only the position he would have been in had the facts been as he believed them to be but also the posi- tion in which he finds himself as a result of his mistake. For example, in the typical case of a mistake as to the price in a bid, the builder must show the profit or loss that will result if he is required to perform, as well as the profit that he would have made had there been no mistake. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Allocation of risk.</i> Here, as under &#167; 152, a party may undertake to perform in spite of a mistake that would otherwise allow him to avoid the contract. It is, of course, unusual for a party to bear the risk of a mistake that the other party had reason to know of or that was caused by his fault within Subparagraph (b). Because of the sig- nificance of allocation of risk in the law of mistake, the scope of this exception is spelled out in detail in &#167; 154. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 154. When a Party Bears the Risk of a Mistake</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A party bears the risk of a mistake when</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the risk is allocated to him by agreement of the parties, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake re- lates but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the risk is allocated to him by the court on the ground that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> Absent provision to the contrary, a contracting party takes the risk of most supervening changes in circumstances, even though they upset basic assumptions and unex- pectedly affect the agreed exchange of performances, unless there is such ex- treme hardship as will justify relief on the ground of impracticability of per- formance or frustration of purpose. A party also bears the risk of many mis- takes as to existing circumstances even though they upset basic assumptions and unexpectedly affect the agreed ex- change of performances. For example, it is commonly understood that the seller of farm land generally cannot avoid the contract of sale upon later discovery by both parties that the land contains valuable mineral deposits, even though the price was negotiated on the basic assumption that the land was suitable only for farming and the effect on the agreed exchange of per- formances is material. In such a case a court will ordinarily allocate the risk of the mistake to the seller, so that he is under a duty to perform regardless of the mistake. The rule stated in this Section determines whether a party bears the risk of a mistake for the pur- poses of both &#167;&#167; 152 and 153. Stating these rules in terms of the allocation of risk avoids such artificial and specious distinctions as are sometimes drawn between &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; and &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; mis- takes or between mistakes that go to the &#8220;identity&#8221; or &#8220;existence&#8221; of the sub- ject matter and those that go merely to its &#8220;attributes,&#8221; &#8220;quality&#8221; or &#8220;value.&#8221; Even though a mistaken party does not bear the risk of a mistake, he may be barred from avoidance if the mistake was the result of his failure to act in good faith and in accordance with rea- sonable standards of fair dealing. See &#167; 157.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Allocation by agreement.</i> The most obvious case of allocation of the risk of a mistake is one in which the par- ties themselves provide for it by their agreement. Just as a party may agree to perform in spite of impracticability or frustration that would otherwise justify his non-performance, he may also agree, by appropriate language or other manifestations, to perform in spite of mistake that would otherwise justify his avoidance. An insurer, for example, may expressly undertake the risk of loss of property covered as of a date already past. Whether the agree- ment places the risk on the mistaken party is a question to be answered un- der the rules generally applicable to the scope of contractual obligations, in- cluding those on interpretation, usage and unconscionability. See Chapter 9.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to sell and B to buy a tract of land. A and B both believe that A has good title, but neither has made a title search. The contract provides that A will con- vey only such title as he has, and A makes no representation with respect to title. In fact, A&#8217;s title is <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>defective. The contract is not void- able by B, because the risk of the mistake is allocated to B by agree- ment of the parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Conscious ignorance.</i> Even though the mistaken party did not agree to bear the risk, he may have been aware when he made the contract that his knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates was limited. If he was not only so aware that his knowledge was limited but un- dertook to perform in the face of that awareness, he bears the risk of the mistake. It is sometimes said in such a situation that, in a sense, there was not mistake but &#8220;conscious ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 2 to &#167; 152, A proposes to B during the nego- tiations the inclusion of a provision under which the adversely affected party can cancel the contract in the event of a material error in the surveyor&#8217;s report, but B refuses to agree to such a provision. The con- tract is not voidable by A, because A bears the risk of the mistake.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Risk allocated by the court.</i> In some instances it is reasonably clear that a party should bear the risk of a mistake for reasons other than those stated in Subparagraphs (a) and (b). In such instances, under the rule stated in Subparagraph (c), the court will al- locate the risk to that party on the ground that it is reasonable to do so. A court will generally do this, for exam- ple, where the seller of farm land seeks to avoid the contract of sale on the ground that valuable mineral rights have newly been found. See Comment a. In dealing with such issues, the court will consider the purposes of the par- ties and will have recourse to its own general knowledge of human behavior in bargain transactions, as it will in the analogous situation in which it is asked to supply a term under the rule stated in &#167; 204. The rule stated in Subsection (c) is subject to contrary agreement and to usage (&#167; 221).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, an owner of land, and B, a builder, make a contract under which B is to take from A&#8217;s land, at a stated rate per cubic yard, all the gravel and earth necessary for the construction of a bridge, an amount estimated to be 114,000 cubic yards. A and B believe that all of the gravel and earth is above water level and can be removed by ordinary means, but in fact about one quarter of it is below water level, so that removal will require special equipment at an additional cost of about twenty per- cent. The contract is not voidable by B, because the court will allocate to B the risk of the mistake. Compare Illustration 5 to &#167; 266.</p>

A and B believe that subsoil conditions are normal, but in fact some of the land must be drained at an expense that will leave A no profit under the contract.

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>&#8230; d. Known mistake as to a ba- sic assumption.</i> In many situations, if one party knows that the other is mis- taken as to a basic assumption, he is expected to disclose the fact that would correct the mistake. A seller of real or personal property is, for example, or- dinarily expected to disclose a known latent defect of quality or title that is of such a character as would probably prevent the buyer from buying at the contract price. An owner is ordinarily expected to disclose a known error in a bid that he has received from a con- tractor. See Comment e to &#167; 153. The mistake must be as to a basic assump- tion, as is also required by the rules on mistake stated in &#167; 152 (see Illus- trations 4, 5 and 6) and &#167; 153 (see Il- lustrations 8 and 9). The rule stated in Clause (b), is, however, broader than these rules for mistake because it does not require a showing of a material ef- fect on the agreed exchange and is not affected by the fact that the party seek- ing relief bears the risk of the mistake (&#167; 154). Nevertheless, a party need not correct all mistakes of the other and is expected only to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing, as reflected in pre- vailing business ethics. A party may, therefore, reasonably expect the other to take normal steps to inform himself and to draw his own conclusions. If the other is indolent, inexperienced or ig- norant, or if his judgment is bad or he lacks access to adequate information, his adversary is not generally expected to compensate for these deficiencies. A buyer of property, for example, is not ordinarily expected to disclose circum- stances that make the property more valuable than the seller supposes. Compare Illustrations 10 and 11. In contrast to the rules stated in Clauses (a) and (d), that stated in Clause (b) is limited to non-disclosure by a party to the transaction. Actual knowledge is required for the application of the rule stated in Clause (b). The case of a party who does not know but has reason to know of a mistake is governed by the rule stated in &#167; 153(b). As to knowledge in the case of an organization, see the analogous rule in Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1&#8211;201(27).</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>&#8230; c. Subjective test of induce- ment.</i> In order to constitute duress, the improper threat must induce the making of the contract. The rule for causation in cases of misrepresenta- tion stated in &#167; 167 is also applied to analogous cases of duress. No special rule for causation in cases of duress is stated here because of the infrequency with which the problem arises. A par- ty&#8217;s manifestation of assent is induced by duress if the duress substantially contributes to his decision to manifest his assent. Compare &#167; 167. The test is subjective and the question is, did the threat actually induce assent on the part of the person claiming to be the victim of duress. Threats that would suffice to induce assent by one person may not suffice to induce assent by another. All attendant circumstances must be considered, including such matters as the age, background and re- lationship of the parties. Persons of a weak or cowardly nature are the very ones that need protection; the coura- geous can usually protect themselves. Timid and inexperienced persons are particularly subject to threats, and it does not lie in the mouths of the un- scrupulous to excuse their imposition on such persons on the ground of their victims&#8217; infirmities. However, here as under &#167; 167 circumstantial evidence may be useful in determining whether a threat did in fact induce assent. For example, although it is not essential that a reasonable person would have believed that the maker of the threat had the ability to execute it, this may be relevant in determining whether the threat actually induced assent. Simi- larly, such factors as the availability of disinterested advice and the length of time that elapses between the making of the threat and the assent may also be relevant in determining whether the threat actually induced the assent.</p>

<p class="indent1">(d) the directness of the connection between that misconduct and the term.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Balancing of interests.</i> Only infrequently does legislation, on grounds of public policy, provide that a term is unenforceable. When a court reaches that conclusion, it usually does so on the basis of a public policy derived either from its own perception of the need to protect some aspect of the public welfare or from legislation that is relevant to that policy although it says nothing explicitly about unen- forceability. See &#167; 179. In some cases the contravention of public policy is so grave, as when an agreement involves a serious crime or tort, that unenforce- ability is plain. In other cases the con- travention is so trivial as that it plain- ly does not preclude enforcement. In doubtful cases, however, a decision as to enforceability is reached only after a careful balancing, in the light of all the circumstances, of the interest in the enforcement of the particular promise against the policy against the enforce- ment of such terms. The most common factors in the balancing process are set out in Subsections (2) and (3). Enforce- ment will be denied only if the factors <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>that argue against enforcement clearly outweigh the law&#8217;s traditional interest in protecting the expectations of the parties, its abhorrence of any unjust enrichment, and any public interest in the enforcement of the particular term. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Connection with term.</i> The extent to which a refusal to enforce a promise or other term on grounds of public policy will further that policy depends not only on the strength of the policy but also on the relation of the term to that policy and to any miscon- duct involved. In most cases there is a promise that involves conduct offensive to the policy. The promise may be one to engage in such conduct. See Illus- tration 6. Or it may be one that tends to induce the other party to engage in such conduct. This tendency may result from the fact that the promise is made in return for the promisee&#8217;s engaging in the conduct (see Illustration 7) or in re- turn for the promisee&#8217;s return promise to engage in the conduct (see Illustra- tion 8). Or it may result from the fact that the duty to perform the promise is conditional on the promisee&#8217;s engag- ing in the conduct (see Illustration 9). In such cases, it is the tendency itself that makes the promise unenforceable, even though the promise does not ac- tually induce the conduct. There are other situations in which the conduct is not itself against public policy, but it is against public policy to promise to engage in such conduct or to attempt to induce it. It is sometimes objection- able to make a commitment to engage in conduct that is not in itself objection- able. This is the case, for example, for a promise to vote in a particular way. See Illustration 10. It is sometimes objec- tionable to attempt to induce conduct that is not in itself objectionable. This is the case, for example, for a promise made in consideration of the promisee&#8217;s voting in a particular way. See Illustra- tion 11. This list does not exhaust all of the possible relations between the conduct and the promise that may jus- tify a decision that the promise is unen- forceable. But as the relation between the conduct and the promise becomes tenuous, it becomes difficult to justify unenforceability unless serious mis- conduct is involved. A party will not be barred from enforcing a promise be- cause of misconduct that is so remote or collateral that refusal to enforce the promise will not deter such con- duct and enforcement will not amount to an inappropriate use of the judicial process. See Illustrations 15 and 16. However, a new promise to perform an earlier promise that was unenforce- able on grounds of public policy is also unenforceable on those grounds unless the circumstances that made the first promise unenforceable no longer exist. The rules stated in &#167;&#167; 183 and 184 in- volve special applications of these gen- eral principles concerning the relation between the conduct and the promise.</p>

See &#167; 193. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Other factors.</i> A court will be reluctant to frustrate a party&#8217;s legiti- mate expectations unless there is a corresponding benefit to be gained in deterring misconduct or avoiding an inappropriate use of the judicial pro- cess. The promisee&#8217;s ignorance or in- advertence, even if it does not bring him within the rule stated in &#167; 180, is one factor in determining the weight to be attached to his expectations. To the extent, however, that he engaged in misconduct that was serious or de- liberate, his claim to protection of his expectations fails. The interest in favor of enforcement becomes much stron- ger after the promisee has relied sub- stantially on those expectations as by preparation or performance. The court will then take into account any enrich- ment of the promisor and any forfeiture by the promisee if he should lose his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially on those expec- tations. See Comment b to &#167; 227. The possibility of restitution may be signifi- cant in this connection. In addition to the interest of the promisee, the court will also weigh any interest that the public or third parties may have in the enforcement of the term in question. Such an interest may be particularly evident where the policy involved is de- signed to protect third parties. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Effect on rest of agreement.</i> The rules stated in this Section deter- mine only whether a particular prom- ise or other term is unenforceable. The question of the effect of such a deter- mination on the rest of the agreement is sometimes a complex one. If there is only one promise in the transac- tion and it is unenforceable, then the question will not arise. (As to the di- visibility of such a promise, however, see &#167;&#167; 184, 185). This is the case for offers that have been accepted by a performance rather than by a promise (&#167; 53), for promises enforceable because of reliance by the promisee (&#167; 90), and for promises under seal (&#167; 95). Fur- thermore, even when there is another promise, it too is often unenforceable under the rules stated in this Section. This is the case, for example, where one party&#8217;s promise is unenforceable because the promised conduct offends public policy and the other party&#8217;s re- turn promise is unenforceable because it tends to induce that conduct. See Il- lustration 8. There are, however, situa- tions in which only one party&#8217;s promise is unenforceable while the other party&#8217;s return promise is enforceable, as is the case where the promisee of the return promise belongs to the class sought to be protected by the policy in question. (That an unenforceable promise may be consideration for a return promise, see &#167; 78.) Finally, there are circum- stances in which the unenforceability of one part of an agreement does not entail the unenforceability of the rest of the agreement, and these are dealt with in &#167;&#167; 183 and 184. As to the effect of public policy on conditions, see &#167; 185.</p>

<p class="noindent">A public policy against the enforcement of promises or other terms may be derived by the court from</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) legislation relevant to such a policy, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the need to protect some aspect of the public welfare, as is the case for the judicial policies against, for example,</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) the interest in the enforcement of the promise is clearly out- weighed by the public policy behind the requirement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 182. Effect of Performance if Intended Use Is Improper</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If the promisee has substantially performed, enforcement of a promise is not precluded on grounds of public policy because of some improper use that the promisor intends to make of what he obtains unless the promisee</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rule of reason.</i> The rules stat- ed in this Section apply to promises not to compete that, because they impose ancillary restraints, are not necessar- ily invalid. Subsection (1) restates in more detail the general rule of reason of &#167; 186 as it applies to such promises. Under this formulation the restraint may be unreasonable in either of two situations. The first occurs when the restraint is greater than necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the promisee. The second occurs when, even though the restraint is not greater <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>than necessary to protect those inter- ests, the promisee&#8217;s need for protec- tion is outweighed by the hardship to the promisor and the likely injury to the public. In the second situation the court may be faced with a particularly difficult task of balancing competing interests. No mathematical formula can be offered for this process.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Need of the promisee.</i> If a re- straint is not ancillary to some trans- action or relationship that gives rise to an interest worthy of protection, the promise is necessarily unreasonable under the rule stated in the preceding Section. In some instances, however, a promise to refrain from competition is a natural and reasonable means of protecting a legitimate interest of the promisee arising out of the transaction to which the restraint is ancillary. In those instances the same reasons ar- gue for its enforceability as in the case of any other promise. For example, competitors who are combining their efforts in a partnership may promise as part of the transaction not to com- pete with the partnership. Assuming that the combination is not monopolis- tic, such promises, reasonable in scope, will be upheld in view of the interest of each party as promisee. See Subsection (2)(c) and Comment h. (It is assumed in the Illustrations to this Section that the arrangements are not objectionable on grounds other than those that come within its scope.) The extent to which the restraint is needed to protect the promisee&#8217;s interests will vary with the nature of the transaction. Where a sale of good will is involved, for example, the buyer&#8217;s interest in what he has ac- quired cannot be effectively realized unless the seller engages not to act so as unreasonably to diminish the value of what he has sold. The same is true of any other property interest of which exclusive use is part of the value. See Subsection (2)(a) and Comment f. In the case of a post-employment restraint, however, the promisee&#8217;s interest is less clear. Such a restraint, in contrast to one accompanying a sale of good will, is not necessary in order for the employer to get the full value of what he has ac- quired. Instead, it must usually be jus- tified on the ground that the employer has a legitimate interest in restraining the employee from appropriating valu- able trade information and customer relationships to which he has had ac- cess in the course of his employment. Arguably the employer does not get the full value of the employment contract if he cannot confidently give the employ- ee access to confidential information needed for most efficient performance of his job. But it is often difficult to dis- tinguish between such information and normal skills of the trade, and prevent- ing use of one may well prevent or in- hibit use of the other. See Subsection (2)(b) and Comment g. Because of this difference in the interest of the prom- isee, courts have generally been more willing to uphold promises to refrain from competition made in connection with sales of good will than those made in connection with contracts of employ- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Harm to the promisor and in- jury to the public.</i> Even if the restraint is no greater than is needed to protect the promisee&#8217;s interest, the promisee&#8217;s need may be outweighed by the harm to the promisor and the likely injury to the public. In the case of a sale of a business, the harm caused to the seller may be excessive if the restraint neces- sitates his complete withdrawal from business; the likely injury to the pub- lic may be too great if it has the effect of removing a former competitor from competition. See Comment f. In the case of a post-employment restraint, the harm caused to the employee may be excessive if the restraint inhibits his personal freedom by preventing him from earning his livelihood if he quits; the likely injury to the public may be too great if it is seriously harmed by the impairment of his economic mobility or <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>by the unavailability of the skills devel- oped in his employment. See Comment g. Not every restraint causes injury to the public, however, and even a post- employment restraint may increase ef- ficiency by encouraging the employer to entrust confidential information to the employee.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Extent of the restraint.</i> The ex- tent of the restraint is a critical factor in determining its reasonableness. The extent may be limited in three ways: by type of activity, by geographical area, and by time. If the promise proscribes types of activity more extensive than necessary to protect those engaged in by the promisee, it goes beyond what is necessary to protect his legitimate interests and is unreasonable. If it cov- ers a geographical area more extensive than necessary to protect his interests, it is also unreasonable. And if the re- straint is to last longer than is required in light of those interests, taking ac- count of such factors as the permanent or transitory nature of technology and information, it is unreasonable. Since, in any of these cases, the restraint is too broad to be justified by the prom- isee&#8217;s need, a court may hold it to be unreasonable without the necessity of weighing the countervailing interests of the promisor and the public. What limits as to activity, geographical area, and time are appropriate in a particu- lar case depends on all the circum- stances. As to the possibility of divis- ibility, see &#167; 183.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Examples of ancillary re- straints.</i> The rule stated in Subsection (1) has its most significant applications with respect to the three types of prom- ises set out in Subsection (2). In each of these situations the promisee may have need for protection sufficient to sustain a promise to refrain from com- petition as long as it is reasonable in extent. They involve promises by the seller of a business, by an employee or agent, and by a partner. The list is not an exclusive one and there may be other situations in which a valid trans- action or relationship gives the prom- isee a legitimate interest sufficient to sustain a promise not to compete.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Promise by seller of a busi- ness.</i> A promise to refrain from compe- tition made in connection with a sale of a business may be reasonable in the light of the buyer&#8217;s need to protect the value of the good will that he has ac- quired. In effect, the seller promises not to act so as to diminish the value of what he has sold. An analogous situa- tion arises when the value of a corpora- tion&#8217;s business depends largely on the good will of one or more of the officers or shareholders. In that situation, offi- cers or shareholders, either on the sale of their shares or on the sale of the cor- poration&#8217;s business, may make an en- forceable promise not to compete with the corporation or with the purchaser of its business, just as the corporation itself could on sale of its business make an enforceable promise to refrain from competition.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Promise by employee or agent.</i> The employer&#8217;s interest in exacting from his employee a promise not to compete after termination of the em- ployment is usually explained on the ground that the employee has acquired either confidential trade information relating to some process or method or the means to attract customers away from the employer. Whether the risk that the employee may do injury to the employer is sufficient to justify a promise to refrain from competition after the termination of the employ- ment will depend on the facts of the particular case. Post-employment re- straints are scrutinized with particular care because they are often the prod- uct of unequal bargaining power and because the employee is likely to give scant attention to the hardship he may later suffer through loss of his liveli- hood. This is especially so where the restraint is imposed by the employer&#8217;s standardized printed form. Cf. &#167; 208. A line must be drawn between the gen- eral skills and knowledge of the trade and information that is peculiar to the employer&#8217;s business. If the employer seeks to justify the restraint on the ground of the employee&#8217;s knowledge of a process or method, the confidentiality of that process or method and its tech- nological life may be critical. The pub- lic interest in workable employer-em- ployee relationships with an efficient use of employees must be balanced against the interest in individual eco- nomic freedom. The court will take ac- count of any diminution in competition likely to result from slowing down the dissemination of ideas and of any im- pairment of the function of the market in shifting manpower to areas of great- est productivity. If the employer seeks to justify the restraint on the ground of the employee&#8217;s ability to attract cus- tomers, the nature, extent and locale of the employee&#8217;s contacts with custom- ers are relevant. A restraint is easier to justify if it is limited to one field of activity among many that are avail- able to the employee. The same is true if the restraint is limited to the taking of his former employer&#8217;s customers as contrasted with competition in general. A restraint may be ancillary to a rela- tionship although, as in the case of an employment at will, no contract of em- ployment is involved. Analogous rules apply to restraints imposed on agents by their principals. As to the duty of an <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>agent not to compete with his principal during the agency relationship, see Re- statement, Second, Agency &#167;&#167; 393, 394.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> In general, if a court will not, on grounds of public policy, aid a promisee by enforcing the promise, it will not aid him by grant- ing him restitution for performance that he has rendered in return for the unenforceable promise. Neither will it aid the promisor by allowing a claim in restitution for performance that he has rendered under the unenforceable promise. It will simply leave both par- ties as it finds them, even though this may result in one of them retaining a benefit that he has received as a result of the transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, the owner of a newspa- per, promises B that he will publish a statement about C known to A and B to be false and defamatory, if B pays him $10,000. B pays A $10,000. Since A&#8217;s promise is unen- forceable on grounds of public policy (&#167; 192), B has no claim in restitu- tion against A. See Illustration 6 to &#167; 178.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A induces B to make an agreement to buy goods on credit from A by bribing B&#8217;s purchasing agent. A&#8217;s bribe tends to induce the agent to violate his fiduciary duty. A delivers the goods to B. Since B&#8217;s promise to pay the price is un- enforceable on grounds of public policy, A has no claim in restitution against B. See &#167; 193 and Illustra- tion 14 to &#167; 178.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Exceptions.</i> Exceptions to the rule denying restitution are made in favor of a party who is excusably ig- norant or is not equally in the wrong (&#167; 198) and in favor of a party who has withdrawn or where the situation is contrary to public policy (&#167; 199). These exceptions are dealt with in the two sections that follow. In addition, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rule is subject to the exception stated in this Section that allows restitution in favor of a party who would otherwise suffer a forfeiture that is disproportion- ate in relation to the contravention of public policy involved. Account will be taken of such factors as the extent of the party&#8217;s deliberate involvement in any misconduct, the gravity of that misconduct, and the strength of the public policy. See &#167; 178(3). The excep- tion is especially appropriate in the case of technical rules or regulations that are drawn so that their strict ap- plication would result in such forfei- ture if restitution were not allowed. Here, as elsewhere in this Restate- ment, the term &#8220;forfeiture&#8221; is used to refer to the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance, on the expectation of that exchange. See Comment b to &#167; 227 and Comment b to &#167; 229. Whether the forfeiture is &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; for the purposes of this Section will depend on the extent of that denial of compensa- tion as compared with the gravity of the public interest involved and the ex- tent of the contravention. If the claim- ant has threatened grave social harm, no forfeiture will be disproportionate. Restitution under this Section is sub- ject to the rules of &#167;&#167; 370&#8211;77.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">3. A makes an agreement with B to sell to B for $10,000 a painting that A, as B knows, has al- ready contracted to sell to C. B pays A $5,000 in advance of delivery. Al- though B&#8217;s promise to pay the price is unenforceable on grounds of pub- lic policy (&#167; 194), denial of restitu- tion would cause B disproportionate forfeiture. B has a claim in restitu- tion against A for $5,000.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, a foreign corporation, makes an agreement with B to sell B goods for $1,000. A delivers the goods but does not comply with a state statute that prohibits a for- eign corporation from doing busi- ness in the state without appoint- ing an agent for service of process and provides that contracts made in violation of the statute are un- enforceable. Although B&#8217;s promise to pay the price is unenforceable on grounds of public policy, denial of restitution would cause A dispro- portionate forfeiture. A has a claim in restitution against B for the goods or their value to B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A, a city, makes an agree- ment with B under which B is to install traffic signals for $50,000. In making the agreement, A fails to comply with a state statute that pre- scribes procedures for making mu- nicipal contracts, so that A&#8217;s prom- ise is unenforceable on grounds of public policy. Although B knows this, he installs the signals.

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Like the obligation of good faith and fair dealing (&#167; 205), the policy against unconscionable con- tracts or terms applies to a wide vari- ety of types of conduct. The determina- tion that a contract or term is or is not unconscionable is made in the light of its setting, purpose and effect. Rele- vant factors include weaknesses in the contracting process like those involved in more specific rules as to contractual capacity, fraud, and other invalidating causes; the policy also overlaps with rules which render particular bargains or terms unenforceable on grounds of public policy. Policing against uncon- scionable contracts or terms has some- times been accomplished &#8220;by adverse construction of language, by manipulation <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the rules of offer and acceptance or by determinations that the clause is contrary to public policy or to the domi- nant purpose of the contract.&#8221; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;302 Comment 1. Particularly in the case of standard- ized agreements, the rule of this Sec- tion permits the court to pass directly on the unconscionability of the contract or clause rather than to avoid uncon- scionable results by interpretation. Compare &#167; 211.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Historic standards.</i> Tradition- ally, a bargain was said to be uncon- scionable in an action at law if it was &#8220;such as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other;&#8221; damages were then limited to those to which the aggrieved party was &#8220;equitably&#8221; entitled. Hume v. United States, 132 U.S. 406 (1889), quoting Earl of Ches- terfield v. Janssen, 2 Ves.Sen. 125, 155, 28 Eng.Rep. 82, 100 (Ch.1750). Even though a contract was fully enforceable in an action for damages, equitable remedies such as specific performance were refused where &#8220;the sum total of its provisions drives too hard a bar- gain for a court of conscience to assist.&#8221; Campbell Soup Co. v. Wentz, 172 F.2d 80, 84 (3d Cir.1948). Modern procedur- al reforms have blurred the distinction between remedies at law and in equity. For contracts for the sale of goods, Uni- form Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;302 states the rule of this Section without distinc- tion between law and equity. Comment 1 to that section adds, &#8220;The principle is one of the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise (Cf. Campbell Soup Co. v. Wentz,) and not of disturbance of allocation of risks because of superior bargaining power.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Overall imbalance.</i> Inadequa- cy of consideration does not of itself in- validate a bargain, but gross disparity in the values exchanged may be an im- portant factor in a determination that a contract is unconscionable and may be sufficient ground, without more, for denying specific performance. See &#167;&#167; 79, 364. Such a disparity may also corroborate indications of defects in the bargaining process, or may affect the remedy to be granted when there is a violation of a more specific rule. Theo- retically it is possible for a contract to be oppressive taken as a whole, even though there is no weakness in the bargaining process and no single term which is in itself unconscionable. Or- dinarily, however, an unconscionable contract involves other factors as well as overall imbalance.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, an individual, contracts in June to sell at a fixed price per ton to B, a large soup manufacturer, the carrots to be grown on A&#8217;s farm. The contract, written on B&#8217;s standard printed form, is obviously drawn to protect B&#8217;s interests and not A&#8217;s; it contains numerous provisions to protect B against various contin- gencies and none giving analogous protection to A. Each of the clauses can be read restrictively so that it is not unconscionable, but several can be read literally to give unrestricted discretion to B. In January, when the market price has risen above the contract price, A repudiates the contract, and B seeks specific per- formance. In the absence of justi- fication by evidence of commercial setting, purpose, or effect, the court may determine that the contract as a whole was unconscionable when made, and may then deny specific performance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A, a homeowner, executes a standard printed form used by B, a merchant, agreeing to pay $1,700 for specified home improvements. A also executes a credit application asking for payment in 60 monthly installments but specifying no rate. Four days later A is informed that the credit application has been approved <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and is given a payment schedule calling for finance and in- surance charges amounting to $800 in addition to the $1,700. Before B does any of the work, A repudi- ates the agreement, and B sues A for $800 damages, claiming that a commission of $800 was paid to B&#8217;s salesman in reliance on the agree- ment. The court may determine that the agreement was unconscio- nable when made, and may then dismiss the claim.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Weakness in the bargaining process.</i> A bargain is not unconscio- nable merely because the parties to it are unequal in bargaining position, nor even because the inequality re- sults in an allocation of risks to the weaker party. But gross inequality of bargaining power, together with terms unreasonably favorable to the stronger party, may confirm indications that the transaction involved elements of decep- tion or compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no meaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact assent or appear to assent to the unfair terms. Factors which may con- tribute to a finding of unconscionabil- ity in the bargaining process include the following: belief by the stronger party that there is no reasonable prob- ability that the weaker party will fully perform the contract; knowledge of the stronger party that the weaker party will be unable to receive substantial benefits from the contract; knowledge of the stronger party that the weaker party is unable reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors. See Uniform Consumer Credit Code &#167; 6.111.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A, literate only in Spanish, is visited in his home by a salesman of refrigerator-freezers for B. They negotiate in Spanish; A tells the salesman he cannot afford to buy the appliance because his job will end in one week, and the salesman tells A that A will be paid numer- ous $25 commissions on sales to his friends. A signs a complex install- ment contract printed in English. The contract provides for a cash price of $900 plus a finance charge of $250. A defaults after paying $32, and B sues for the balance plus late charges and a 20% attorney&#8217;s fee authorized by the contract. The ap- pliance cost B $350. The court may determine that the contract was un- conscionable when made, and may then limit B&#8217;s recovery to a reason- able sum.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Unconscionable terms.</i> Par- ticular terms may be unconscionable whether or not the contract as a whole is unconscionable. Some types of terms are not enforced, regardless of context; examples are provisions for unreason- ably large liquidated damages, or limi- tations on a debtor&#8217;s right to redeem collateral. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;718, 9&#8211;501(3). Other terms may be unconscionable in some con- texts but not in others. Overall imbal- ance and weaknesses in the bargaining process are then important.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, a packer, sells and ships 300 cases of canned catsup to B, a wholesale grocer. The contract pro- vides, &#8220;All claims other than swells must be made within ten days from receipt of goods.&#8221; Six months later a government inspector, upon mi- croscopic examination of samples, finds excessive mold in the cans and obtains a court order for destruc- tion of the 270 remaining cases in B&#8217;s warehouse. In the absence of justifying evidence, the court may determine that the quoted clause is unconscionable as applied to latent defects and does not bar a claim for <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>damages for breach of warranty by B against A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A, a retail furniture store, sells furniture on installment credit to B, retaining a security interest. As A knows, B is a woman of lim- ited education, separated from her husband, maintaining herself and seven children by means of $218 per month public assistance. After 13 purchases over a period of five years for a total of $1,200, B owes A $164. B then buys a stereo set for $514. Each contract contains a paragraph of some 800 words in ex- tremely fine print, in the middle of which are the words &#8220;all payments shall be credited pro rata on all out- standing accounts.&#8221; The effect of this language is to keep a balance due on each item until all are paid for. On B&#8217;s default, A sues for pos- session of all the items sold. It may be determined that either the quot- ed clause or the contract as a whole was unconscionable when made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A, a corporation with its principal office in State X, contracts with B, a resident of State X, to make improvements on B&#8217;s home in State X. The contract is made on A&#8217;s standard printed form, which contains a clause by which the par- ties submit to the jurisdiction of a court in State Y, 200 miles away. No reason for the clause appears except to make litigation inconvenient and expensive for B. The clause is un- conscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Law and fact.</i> A determination that a contract or term is unconsciona- ble is made by the court in the light of all the material facts. Under Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;302, the deter- mination is made &#8220;as a matter of law,&#8221; but the parties are to be afforded an opportunity to present evidence as to commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in its determination. Incidental findings of fact are made by the court rather than by a jury, but are accorded the usual weight given to such findings of fact in appellate re- view. An appellate court will also con- sider whether proper standards were applied.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A, a finance company, lends money to B, a manufactur- ing company, on the security of an assignment by B of its accounts re- ceivable. The agreement provides for loans of 75% of the value of as- signed accounts acceptable to A, and forbids B to dispose of or hypothe- cate any assets without A&#8217;s written consent. The agreed interest rate of 18% would be usurious but for a statute precluding a corporation from raising the defense of usury. Substantial advances are made, and the balance owed is $14,000 when B becomes bankrupt, three months after the first advance. A determination that the agreement is unconscionable on its face, with- out regard to context, is error. The agreement is unconscionable only if it is not a reasonable commercial device in the light of all the circum- stances when it was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Remedies.</i> Perhaps the sim- plest application of the policy against unconscionable agreements is the de- nial of specific performance where the contract as a whole was unconscionable when made. If such a contract is en- tirely executory, denial of money dam- ages may also be appropriate. But the policy is not penal: unless the parties can be restored to their pre-contract positions, the offending party will or- dinarily be awarded at least the rea- sonable value of performance rendered by him. Where a term rather than the entire contract is unconscionable, the appropriate remedy is ordinarily to deny effect to the unconscionable term. In such cases as that of an exculpatory <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>term, the effect may be to enlarge the liability of the offending party.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Complete integration.</i> The def- inition in Subsection (1) is to be read with the definition of integrated agree- ment in &#167; 209, to reject the assumption sometimes made that because a writ- ing has been worked out which is final on some matters, it is to be taken as including all the matters agreed upon. Even though there is an integrated agreement, consistent additional terms not reduced to writing may be shown, unless the court finds that the writing was assented to by both parties as a complete and exclusive statement of all the terms. Upon such a finding, how- ever, evidence of the alleged making of consistent additional terms must be kept from the trier of fact. See &#167; 216; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;202 Comment 3.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Proof of complete integration.</i> That a writing was or was not adopt- ed as a completely integrated agree- ment may be proved by any relevant evidence. A document in the form of a written contract, signed by both par- ties and apparently complete on its face, may be decisive of the issue in the absence of credible contrary evidence. But a writing cannot of itself prove its own completeness, and wide latitude must be allowed for inquiry into cir- cumstances bearing on the intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a college, owns premises which have no toilet or plumbing fa- cilities or heating equipment. In ne- gotiating a lease to B for use of the premises as a radio station, A orally agrees to permit the use of facilities in an adjacent building and to pro- vide heat. The parties subsequently execute a written lease agreement which makes no mention of facili- ties or heat. The question whether the written lease was adopted as a completely integrated agreement is to be decided on the basis of all relevant evidence of the prior and contemporaneous conduct and lan- guage of the parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Partial integration.</i> It is often clear from the face of a writing that it is incomplete and cannot be more than a partially integrated agreement. In- completeness may also be shown by other writings, which may or may not become part of a completely or partial- ly integrated agreement. Or it may be shown by any relevant evidence, oral or written, that an apparently complete writing never became fully effective, or that it was modified after initial adop- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A writes to B a letter offer containing four provisions. B replies by letter that three of the provisions are satisfactory, but makes a coun- ter proposal as to the fourth. After further discussion of the fourth provision, the parties come to oral agreement on a revision of it, but make no further statements as to the other three terms. A&#8217;s letter is a partially integrated agreement with respect to the first three provi- sions.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 211. Standardized Agreements</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (3), where a party to an agreement signs or otherwise manifests assent to a writing and has reason to believe that like writings are regularly used to embody terms of agreements of the same type, he adopts the writing as an integrated agreement with respect to the terms included in the writing.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Such a writing is interpreted wherever reasonable as treating alike all those similarly situated, without regard to their knowledge or understanding of the standard terms of the writing.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where the other party has reason to believe that the party mani- festing such assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term, the term is not part of the agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Utility of standardization.</i> Standardization of agreements serves many of the same functions as stan- dardization of goods and services; both are essential to a system of mass pro- duction and distribution. Scarce and costly time and skill can be devoted to a class of transactions rather than to details of individual transactions. Le- gal rules which would apply in the ab- sence of agreement can be shaped to fit the particular type of transaction, and extra copies of the form can be used for purposes such as record-keeping, coor- dination and supervision. Forms can be tailored to office routines, the training of personnel, and the requirements of mechanical equipment. Sales person- nel and customers are freed from atten- tion to numberless variations and can focus on meaningful choice among a limited number of significant features: <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>transaction-type, style, quantity, price, or the like. Operations are simplified and costs reduced, to the advantage of all concerned.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Assent to unknown terms.</i> A party who makes regular use of a stan- dardized form of agreement does not ordinarily expect his customers to un- derstand or even to read the standard terms. One of the purposes of standard- ization is to eliminate bargaining over details of individual transactions, and that purpose would not be served if a substantial number of customers re- tained counsel and reviewed the stan- dard terms. Employees regularly using a form often have only a limited under- standing of its terms and limited au- thority to vary them. Customers do not in fact ordinarily understand or even read the standard terms. They trust to the good faith of the party using the form and to the tacit representa- tion that like terms are being accepted regularly by others similarly situated. But they understand that they are as- senting to the terms not read or not un- derstood, subject to such limitations as the law may impose.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Review of unfair terms.</i> Stan- dardized agreements are commonly prepared by one party. The customer assents to a few terms, typically in- serted in blanks on the printed form, and gives blanket assent to the type of transaction embodied in the standard form. He is commonly not represented in the drafting, and the draftsman may be tempted to overdraw in the interest of his employer. The obvious danger of overreaching has resulted in gov- ernment regulation of insurance poli- cies, bills of lading, retail installment sales, small loans, and other particular types of contracts. Regulation some- times includes administrative review of standard terms, or even prescription of terms. Apart from such regulation, standard terms imposed by one party are enforced. But standard terms may be superseded by separately negotiated or added terms (&#167; 203), they are con- strued against the draftsman (&#167; 206), and they are subject to the overriding obligation of good faith (&#167; 205) and to the power of the court to refuse to enforce an unconscionable contract or term (&#167; 208). Moreover, various con- tracts and terms are against public policy and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Non-contractual documents.</i> The same document may serve both contractual and other purposes, and a party may assent to it for other pur- poses without understanding that it embodies contract terms. He may nev- ertheless be bound if he has reason to know that it is used to embody contract terms. Insurance policies, steamship tickets, bills of lading, and warehouse receipts are commonly so obviously contractual in form as to give the cus- tomer reason to know their character. But baggage checks or automobile parking lot tickets may appear to be mere identification tokens, and a party without knowledge or reason to know that the token purports to be a contract is then not bound by terms printed on the token. Documents such as invoices, instructions for use, and the like, deliv- ered after a contract is made, may raise similar problems.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Equality of treatment.</i> One who assents to standard contract terms normally assumes that others are doing likewise and that all who do so are on an equal footing. In the case of a public utility, that assumption is fortified by statutory and common law limitations on discrimination among customers; a term prescribed by statute or regu- lation in the case of an insurance pol- icy also carries an assurance of equal treatment. Apart from government regulation, courts in construing and applying a standardized contract seek to effectuate the reasonable expecta- tions of the average member of the public who accepts it. The result may be to give the advantage of a restrictive reading to some sophisticated customers <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>who contracted with knowledge of an ambiguity or dispute.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Terms excluded.</i> Subsection (3) applies to standardized agree- ments the general principles stated in &#167;&#167; 20 and 201. Although customers typically adhere to standardized agree- ments and are bound by them without even appearing to know the standard terms in detail, they are not bound to unknown terms which are beyond the range of reasonable expectation. A debtor who delivers a check to his cred- itor with the amount blank does not authorize the insertion of an infinite figure. Similarly, a party who adheres to the other party&#8217;s standard terms does not assent to a term if the other party has reason to believe that the ad- hering party would not have accepted the agreement if he had known that the agreement contained the particu- lar term. Such a belief or assumption may be shown by the prior negotiations or inferred from the circumstances. Reason to believe may be inferred from the fact that the term is bizarre or op- pressive, from the fact that it eviscer- ates the non-standard terms explic- itly agreed to, or from the fact that it eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction. The inference is rein- forced if the adhering party never had an opportunity to read the term, or if it is illegible or otherwise hidden from view. This rule is closely related to the policy against unconscionable terms and the rule of interpretation against the draftsman. See &#167;&#167; 206 and 208.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 212. Interpretation of Integrated Agreement</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circum- stances, in accordance with the rules stated in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined by the trier of fact if it depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from ex- trinsic evidence. Otherwise a question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined as a question of law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 213. Effect of Integrated Agreement on Prior Agreements (Parol Evidence Rule)</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A binding integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that it is inconsistent with them.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A binding completely integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that they are within its scope.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) An integrated agreement that is not binding or that is voidable and avoided does not discharge a prior agreement. But an integrated agreement, even though not binding, may be effective to render inopera- tive a term which would have been part of the agreement if it had not been integrated.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 214. Evidence of Prior or Contemporaneous Agreements and Negotiations</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous with the adop- tion of a writing are admissible in evidence to establish</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) that the writing is or is not an integrated agreement;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) that the integrated agreement, if any, is completely or par- tially integrated;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the meaning of the writing, whether or not integrated;</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 215. Contradiction of Integrated Terms</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Except as stated in the preceding Section, where there is a binding agree- ment, either completely or partially integrated, evidence of prior or con- temporaneous agreements or negotiations is not admissible in evidence to contradict a term of the writing.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 216. Consistent Additional Terms</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Evidence of a consistent additional term is admissible to supple- ment an integrated agreement unless the court finds that the agreement was completely integrated.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An agreement is not completely integrated if the writing omits a consistent additional agreed term which is</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) agreed to for separate consideration, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) such a term as in the circumstances might naturally be omit- ted from the writing.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 217. Integrated Agreement Subject to Oral Requirement of a Condition</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where the parties to a written agreement agree orally that performance of the agreement is subject to the occurrence of a stated condition, the agreement is not integrated with respect to the oral condition.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 218. Untrue Recitals; Evidence of Consideration</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A recital of a fact in an integrated agreement may be shown to be untrue.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Evidence is admissible to prove whether or not there is consid- eration for a promise, even though the parties have reduced their agree- ment to a writing which appears to be a completely integrated agreement.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 4. SCOPE AS AFFECTED BY USAGE</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 219. Usage</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Usage is habitual or customary practice.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 220. Usage Relevant to Interpretation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An agreement is interpreted in accordance with a relevant usage if each party knew or had reason to know of the usage and neither party knew or had reason to know that the meaning attached by the other was inconsistent with the usage.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When the meaning attached by one party accorded with a rel- evant usage and the other knew or had reason to know of the usage, the other is treated as having known or had reason to know the meaning at- tached by the first party.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 221. Usage Supplementing an Agreement</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An agreement is supplemented or qualified by a reasonable usage with respect to agreements of the same type if each party knows or has reason to know of the usage and neither party knows or has reason to know that the other party has an intention inconsistent with the usage.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 222. Usage of Trade</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A usage of trade is a usage having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be ob- served with respect to a particular agreement. It may include a system of rules regularly observed even though particular rules are changed from time to time.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The existence and scope of a usage of trade are to be determined as questions of fact. If a usage is embodied in a written trade code or simi- lar writing the interpretation of the writing is to be determined by the court as a question of law.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Unless otherwise agreed, a usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which the parties are engaged or a usage of trade of which they know or have reason to know gives meaning to or supplements or qualifies their agreement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 223. Course of Dealing</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A course of dealing is a sequence of previous conduct between the parties to an agreement which is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless otherwise agreed, a course of dealing between the parties gives meaning to or supplements or qualifies their agreement.</p>
<p class="head3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>TOPIC 5. CONDITIONS AND SIMILAR EVENTS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 224. Condition Defined</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A condition is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. &#8220;Condition&#8221; limited to event.</i> &#8220;Condition&#8221; is used in this Restate- ment to denote an event which quali- fies a duty under a contract. See the Introductory Note to this Topic. It is recognized that &#8220;condition&#8221; is used with a wide variety of other meanings in legal discourse. Sometimes it is used to denote an event that limits or quali- fies a transfer of property. In the law of trusts, for example, it is used to de- note an event such as the death of the settlor that qualifies his disposition of property in trust. See Restatement, Second, Trusts &#167; 360. See also the rules on &#8220;conditional&#8221; delivery (&#167; 103) and &#8220;conditional&#8221; assignment (&#167;&#167; 103, 331). Sometimes it is used to refer to a term (&#167; 5) in an agreement that makes an event a condition, or more broadly to refer to any term in an agreement (e.g., &#8220;standard conditions of sale&#8221;). For the sake of precision, &#8220;condition&#8221; is not used here in these other senses.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to sell and B to buy goods pursuant to a writing which provides, under the heading &#8220;Conditions of Sale,&#8221; that &#8220;the ob- ligations of the parties are condi- tional on B obtaining from X Bank by June 30 a letter of credit&#8221; on stated terms. The quoted language is a term of the agreement (&#167; 5), not a condition. The event referred to by the term, obtaining the letter of credit by June 30, is a condition.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Uncertainty of event.</i> Whether the reason for making an event a con- dition is to shift to the obligee the risk of its non-occurrence, or whether it is to induce the obligee to cause the event to occur (see Introductory Note to this Topic), there is inherent in the concept of condition some degree of uncertain- ty as to the occurrence of the event. Therefore, the mere passage of time, as to which there is no uncertainty, is not a condition and a duty is uncon- ditional if nothing but the passage of time is necessary to give rise to a duty of performance. Moreover, an event is not a condition, even though its occur- rence is uncertain, if it is referred to merely to measure the passage of time after which an obligor is to perform. See Comment b to &#167; 227. Performance under a contract becomes due when all necessary events, including any condi- tions and the passage of any required time, have occurred so that a failure of performance will be a breach. See &#167;&#167; 231&#8211;43.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The event need not, in order to be a condition, be one that is to occur after the making of the contract, although that is commonly the case. It may re- late to the present or even to the past, as is the case where a marine policy in- sures against a loss that may already have occurred. Furthermore, a duty may be conditioned upon the failure of something to happen rather than upon its happening, and in that case its fail- ure to happen is the event that is the condition.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A tells B, &#8220;If you will paint my house, I will pay you $1,000 on condition that 30 days have passed after you have finished.&#8221; B paints A&#8217;s house. Although A is not under a duty to pay B $1,000 until 30 days <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>have passed, the passage of that time is not a condition of A&#8217;s duty to pay B $1,000.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A contracts to sell and B to buy goods to be shipped &#8220;C.I.F.,&#8221; payment to be &#8220;on arrival of goods.&#8221; Risk of loss of the goods passes from A to B when A, having otherwise complied with the C.I.F. term of the contract, puts the goods in the possession of the carrier (Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;320(2)). If the goods are lost in transit, B is under a duty to pay the price when the goods should have arrived (Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;709(1)(a), 2&#8211;321(3)). The arrival of the goods is not a condition of B&#8217;s duty to pay for the goods.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Necessity of a contract.</i> In or- der for an event to be a condition, it must qualify a duty under an existing contract. Events which are part of the process of formation of a contract, such as offer and acceptance, are therefore excluded under the definition in this section. It is not customary to call such events conditions. But cf. &#167; 36(2) (&#8220;con- dition of acceptance&#8221;). For the most part, they are required by law and may not be dispensed with by the parties, while conditions are the result of, or at least subject to, agreement. Where, however, an offer has become an option contract, e.g., by the payment of a dol- lar (&#167; 87), the acceptance is a condition under the definition in this section.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A tells B, &#8220;I promise to pay you $1,000 if you paint my house.&#8221; B begins to paint A&#8217;s house. Since B&#8217;s beginning of the invited perfor- mance gives rise to an option con- tract, B&#8217;s completion of performance is a condition of A&#8217;s duty under that contract to pay B $1,000. See &#167; 45.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Relationship of conditions.</i> A duty may be subject to any number of conditions, which may be related to each other in various ways. They may be cumulative so that performance will not become due unless all of them oc- cur. They may be alternative so that performance may become due if any one of them occurs. Or some may be cumulative and some alternative. Fur- thermore, a condition may qualify the duties of both parties. Cf. &#167; 217.</p>

A&#8217;s tender of $1,000,000 by August 18 and his being in such financial con- dition that he can keep the painting for his personal enjoyment are cu- mulative conditions and redelivery of the painting does not become due unless both of them occur.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A purchases land from Mrs. B, who is unable to get Mr. B to join her in signing the deed be- cause they are engaged in divorce proceedings. A takes possession un- der a deed signed by Mrs. B, pays Mrs. B $10,000 and promises to pay an additional $5,000 &#8220;if, within one year, (1) Mr. and Mrs. B execute a quitclaim deed to A, or (2) Mrs. B furnishes A with a certificate of the death of Mr. B with Mrs. B surviv- ing him, or (3) Mrs. B as a single person executes a quitclaim deed to A after having been awarded the land following the entry of a final decree of divorce from Mr. B.&#8221; The three enumerated events are alter- native conditions and A&#8217;s payment of $5,000 to Mrs. B becomes due if any of them occurs.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A and B contract to merge their corporate holdings into a sin- gle new company. It is agreed that the project is not to be operative unless <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the parties raise $600,000 ad- ditional capital. The raising of the additional capital is a condition of the duties of both A and B. If it is not raised, neither A&#8217;s nor B&#8217;s per- formance becomes due.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Occurrence of event as dis- charge.</i> Parties sometimes provide that the occurrence of an event, such as the failure of one of them to commence an action within a prescribed time, will ex- tinguish a duty after performance has become due, along with any claim for breach. Such an event has often been called a &#8220;condition subsequent,&#8221; while an event of the kind defined in this sec- tion has been called a &#8220;condition prece- dent.&#8221; This terminology is not followed here. Since a &#8220;condition subsequent,&#8221; so-called, is subject to the rules on dis- charge in &#167; 230, and not to the follow- ing rules on conditions, it is not called a &#8220;condition&#8221; in this Restatement. Oc- casionally, although the language of an agreement says that if an event does not occur a duty is &#8220;extinguished,&#8221; &#8220;discharged,&#8221; or &#8220;terminated,&#8221; it can be seen from the circumstances that the event must ordinarily occur before per- formance of the duty can be expected. When a court concludes that, for this reason, performance is not to become due unless the event occurs, the event is, in spite of the language, a condition of the duty. See &#167; 227(3). See also Com- ment a to &#167; 230.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">8. A insures B&#8217;s property against theft. The policy provides that B&#8217;s failure to notify A within 30 days after loss shall &#8220;terminate&#8221; A&#8217;s duty to pay and that suit must be brought within one year after loss. Since it can be seen from the circumstances that notice must or- dinarily be given before payment by A can be expected, B&#8217;s notification of A within 30 days after loss is a condition of A&#8217;s duty. B&#8217;s bringing suit against A within a year after loss is not a condition of A&#8217;s duty. B&#8217;s failure to bring suit within that time will discharge A&#8217;s duty after payment has become due, along with any claim for breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A and B make a contract under which A promises to pay B $10,000 in annual installments of $1,000 each, beginning the follow- ing January 1, with a provision that &#8220;no installments whether or not overdue and unpaid shall be pay- able in case of A&#8217;s death within the 10 years.&#8221; A&#8217;s being alive is a condi- tion of his duty to pay any install- ment. A&#8217;s death within ten years will discharge his duty to pay any installment after payment has be- come due, along with any claim for breach.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) In resolving doubts as to whether an event is made a condition of an obligor&#8217;s duty, and as to the nature of such an event, an interpretation is preferred that will reduce the obligee&#8217;s risk of forfeiture, unless the event is within the obligee&#8217;s control or the circumstances indicate that he has assumed the risk.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless the contract is of a type under which only one party gener- ally undertakes duties, when it is doubtful whether</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) a duty is imposed on an obligee that an event occur, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the event is made a condition of the obligor&#8217;s duty, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the event is made a condition of the obligor&#8217;s duty and a duty is imposed on the obligee that the event occur,</p>
<p class="noindent">the first interpretation is preferred if the event is within the obligee&#8217;s control.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In case of doubt, an interpretation under which an event is a con- dition of an obligor&#8217;s duty is preferred over an interpretation under which the non-occurrence of the event is a ground for discharge of that duty after it has become a duty to perform.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> The present Section states three standards of preference used in the process of interpretation with regard to conditions. They supple- ment the standards of preference in &#167; 203, as well as the other rules set out in Topics 1 through 4 of this Chapter.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Condition or not.</i> The non-oc- currence of a condition of an obligor&#8217;s duty may cause the obligee to lose his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially on the expecta- tion of that exchange, as by preparation or performance. The word &#8220;forfeiture&#8221; is used in this Restatement to refer to the denial of compensation that results in such a case. The policy favoring free- dom of contract requires that, within broad limits (see &#167; 229), the agreement of the parties should be honored even though forfeiture results. When, how- ever, it is doubtful whether or not the agreement makes an event a condition of an obligor&#8217;s duty, an interpretation is preferred that will reduce the risk of forfeiture. For example, under a pro- vision that a duty is to be performed &#8220;when&#8221; an event occurs, it may be doubtful whether it is to be performed only if that event occurs, in which case the event is a condition, or at such time as it would ordinarily occur, in which case the event is referred to merely to measure the passage of time. In the latter case, if the event does not occur some alternative means will be found to measure the passage of time, and the non-occurrence of the event will not prevent the obligor&#8217;s duty from be- coming one of performance. If the event is a condition, however, the obligee takes the risk that its non-occurrence will discharge the obligor&#8217;s duty. See &#167; 225(2). When the nature of the condition <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>is such that the uncertainty as to the event will be resolved before either party has relied on its anticipated oc- currence, both parties can be entirely relieved of their duties, and the obli- gee risks only the loss of his expecta- tions. When, however, the nature of the condition is such that the uncertainty is not likely to be resolved until after the obligee has relied by preparing to perform or by performing at least in part, he risks forfeiture. If the event is within his control, he will often assume this risk. If it is not within his control, it is sufficiently unusual for him to as- sume the risk that, in case of doubt, an interpretation is preferred under which the event is not a condition. The rule is, of course, subject to a showing of a contrary intention, and even with- out clear language, circumstances may show that he assumed the risk of its non-occurrence.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Although the rule is consistent with a policy of avoiding forfeiture and un- just enrichment, it is not directed at the avoidance of actual forfeiture and un- just enrichment. Since the intentions of the parties must be taken as of the time the contract was made, the test is whether a particular interpretation would have avoided the risk of forfei- ture viewed as of that time, not wheth- er it will avoid actual forfeiture in the resolution of a dispute that has arisen later. Excuse of the non-occurrence of a condition because of actual forfeiture is dealt with in &#167; 229, and rules for the avoidance of unjust enrichment as such are dealt with in the Restatement of Restitution and in Chapter 16 of this Restatement, particularly &#167;&#167; 370&#8211;77.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a general contractor, contracts with B, a sub-contractor, for the plumbing work on a con- struction project. B is to receive $100,000, &#8220;no part of which shall be due until five days after Owner shall have paid Contractor there- for.&#8221; B does the plumbing work, but the owner becomes insolvent and fails to pay A. A is under a duty to pay B after a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A, a mining company, hires B, an engineer, to help reopen one of its mines for &#8220;$10,000 to be payable as soon as the mine is in successful operation.&#8221; $10,000 is a reasonable compensation for B&#8217;s service. B per- forms the required services, but the attempt to reopen the mine is un- successful and A abandons it. A is under a duty to pay B $10,000 after the passage of a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A, a mining company, con- tracts with B, the owner of an un- tested experimental patented pro- cess, to help reopen one of its mines for $5,000 paid in advance and an additional &#8220;$15,000 to be payable as soon as the mine is in success- ful operation.&#8221; $10,000 is a reason- able compensation for B&#8217;s services. B performs the required services, but because the process proves to be unsuccessful, A abandons the at- tempt to reopen the mine. A is un- der no duty to pay B any additional amount. In all the circumstances the risk of failure of the process was, to that extent, assumed by B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy land for $100,000. At the same time, A contracts to pay C, a real estate broker, as his commis- sion, $5,000 &#8220;on the closing of title.&#8221; B refuses to consummate the sale. Absent a showing of a contrary in- tention, a court may conclude that C assumed this risk, and that A&#8217;s duty is conditional on the sale be- ing consummated. A is then under no duty to pay C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Nature of event.</i> In determin- ing the nature of the event that is made a condition by the agreement, as in determining whether the agreement makes an event a condition in the first place (see Comment b), it will not ordinarily <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>be supposed that a party has as- sumed the risk of forfeiture. Where the language is doubtful, an interpretation is generally preferred that will avoid this risk. This standard of preference finds an important application in the case of promises to pay for work done if some independent third party, such as an architect, surveyor or engineer, is satisfied with it, where the risk of for- feiture in the case of a judgment that is dishonest or based on a gross mistake as to the facts is substantial. The stan- dard does not, however, help a party if the condition is within his control or if the circumstances otherwise indicate that he assumed that risk.</p>

A contracts with B to re- pair B&#8217;s building for $20,000, pay- ment to be made &#8220;on the satisfac- tion of C, B&#8217;s architect, and the issuance of his certificate.&#8221; A makes the repairs, but C refuses to issue his certificate, and explains why he is not satisfied. Other experts in the field consider A&#8217;s performance to be satisfactory and disagree with C&#8217;s explanation. A has no claim against B. The quoted language is sufficiently clear that Subsection (1) does not apply. If C is honestly not satisfied, B is under no duty to pay A, and it makes no difference if his dissatisfaction was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, C refuses to issue his certificate although he admits that he is satisfied. A has a claim against B for $20,000. The quoted language will be interpreted so that the requirement of the cer- tificate is merely evidentiary and the condition occurs when there is, as here, adequate evidence that C is honestly satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, C does not make a proper inspection of the work and gives no reasons for his dissatisfaction. A has a claim against B for $20,000. In using the quoted language, A and B assumed that C would exercise an honest judgment and by failing to make a proper inspection, C did not exer- cise such a judgment. Since the par- ties have omitted an essential term to cover this situation, the court will supply a term (see &#167; 204) requiring A to pay B if C ought reasonably to have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, C makes a gross mistake with reference to the facts on which his refusal to give a certificate is based. A has a claim against B for $20,000. In using the quoted language, A and B assumed that C would exercise his judgment without a gross mistake as to the facts. Since the parties have omit- ted an essential term to cover this situation, the court will supply a term (see &#167; 204) requiring A to pay B if C ought reasonably to have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Condition or duty.</i> When an obligor wants the obligee to do an act, the obligor may make his own duty conditional on the obligee doing it and may also have the obligee promise to do it. Or he may merely make his own duty conditional on the obligee doing it. Or he may merely have the obligee promise to do it. (See Introductory Note to this Topic and Comment d to &#167; 225). It may not be clear, however, which he has done. The rule in Subsection (2) states a preference for an interpre- tation that merely imposes a duty on the obligee to do the act and does not make the doing of the act a condition of the obligor&#8217;s duty. The preferred in- terpretation avoids the harsh results that might otherwise result from the non-occurrence of a condition and still gives adequate protection to the obligor under the rules of Chapter 10 relating to performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises. Under those <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rules, particularly &#167;&#167; 237&#8211;41, the obli- gee&#8217;s failure to perform his duty has, if it is material, the effect of the non-oc- currence of a condition of the obligor&#8217;s duty. Unless the agreement makes it clear that the event is required as a condition, it is fairer to apply these more flexible rules. The obligor will, in any case, have a remedy for breach. In many instances the rule in Subsection (1) will also apply and will reinforce the preference stated in Subsection (2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This standard of preference ap- plies only where the event is within the obligee&#8217;s control. Where it is within the obligor&#8217;s control (e.g., his honest satisfaction with the obligee&#8217;s perfor- mance), within a third party&#8217;s control (e.g., an architect&#8217;s satisfaction with performance), or within no one&#8217;s con- trol (e.g., the accidental destruction of the subject matter), the preferential rule does not apply since it is not usual for the obligee to undertake a duty that such an event will occur. Although the obligee can, by appropriate language, undertake a duty that an event that is not within his control will occur, such an undertaking must be derived from the agreement of the parties under the general rules of interpretation stated earlier in the present Chapter without resort to this standard of preference.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Furthermore, this standard of pref- erence does not apply when the con- tract is of a type under which only the obligor generally undertakes duties. It therefore does not apply to the typical insurance contract under which only the insurer generally undertakes du- ties, and a term requiring an act to be done by the insured is not subject to this standard of preference. In view of the general understanding that only the insurer undertakes duties, the term will be interpreted as making that event a condition of the insurer&#8217;s duty rather than as imposing a duty on the insured.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Condition or discharge.</i> Cir- cumstances may show that the parties intended to make an event a condi- tion of an obligor&#8217;s duty even though their language appears to make the non-occurrence of the event a ground <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>for discharge of his duty after perfor- mance has become due. See Comment e to &#167; 224. An example is the tradi- tional form of bond, which states that the obligor is under a duty to perform, but that the duty will be discharged if something happens. The language, in spite of its form, is interpreted so that the failure of that thing to happen is a condition of the obligor&#8217;s duty. Unless that condition occurs, no performance is due. Although this form of expres- sion persists in legal documents, only rarely do the parties intend that one of them shall be under a duty to perform which is to cease on the occurrence of something that is still uncertain. The clearest language is therefore neces- sary to justify such an interpretation, and if the language is doubtful a con- trary interpretation is preferred.</p>

<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. PERFORMANCES TO BE EXCHANGED UNDER AN EXCHANGE OF PROMISES</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 231. Criterion for Determining When Performances Are to Be Exchanged Under an Exchange of Promises</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises if each promise is at least part of the consideration for the other and the perfor- mance of each promise is to be exchanged at least in part for the perfor- mance of the other.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 232. When it is Presumed That Performances Are to Be Exchanged Under an Exchange of Promises</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where the consideration given by each party to a contract consists in whole or in part of promises, all the performances to be rendered by each party taken collectively are treated as performances to be exchanged un- der an exchange of promises, unless a contrary intention is clearly mani- fested.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Reason for presumption.</i> The rules applicable to performances to be exchanged under an exchange of prom- ises are designed to give the parties maximum protection, consistent with freedom of contract, against disap- pointment of their expectation of a sub- sequent exchange of those performanc- es. When the parties have exchanged promises, there is ordinarily every reason to suppose that they contracted on the basis of such an expectation since the exchange of promises would otherwise have little purpose. Even absent a showing of their actual inten- tions, fairness dictates that such an expectation be assumed. This Section therefore states a presumption in favor of the conclusion that, in such a case, the performances are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. For one of the parties to show that the ex- pectation was otherwise, the contrary intention must be clearly manifested. The presumption applies regardless of whether the promises are written or oral or both, and even where a nego- tiable instrument is involved. See Uni- form Commercial Code &#167; 3&#8211;408. It also applies even though the consideration given by a party consists partly of some <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>performance and only partly of a prom- ise (see Comment c to &#167; 231), although it is possible that in such a case the promise may be so minor and inciden- tal that its non-performance would not be a material failure of performance. See Comment b to &#167; 241.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a wholesaler, promises to sell and B, a retailer, promises to buy goods together with related advertising material, payment to be made within 30 days of delivery. A also promises not to sell similar advertising material to any other retailer in B&#8217;s city. A sells similar advertising material to another re- tailer in B&#8217;s city, and B thereupon refuses to take or pay for the goods. A&#8217;s selling B goods together with advertising material and not selling others similar advertising material, taken collectively, and B&#8217;s payment are to be exchanged under the ex- change of promises. Therefore, un- der the rule stated in &#167; 237, if A&#8217;s failure of performance is material, A has no claim against B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A promises to sell to B a lot in a subdivision for $8,000. B prom- ises to pay in four annual install- ments of $2,000 each, beginning one year after execution of the con- tract. A promises to begin to make improvements and pave the streets within 60 days and to complete work within a reasonable time and promises to deliver a deed at the time of the final payment. A fails to pave the streets, and B thereupon refuses to pay any installments. A&#8217;s making improvements, pav- ing streets, and delivering a deed, taken collectively, and B&#8217;s paying installments are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. Therefore, under the rule stated in &#167; 237, if A&#8217;s failure of performance is material, A has no claim against B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A employs B under a five- year employment contract, which contains a valid covenant under which B promises not to engage in the same business in a designated area for two years after the termi- nation of the employment. It ex- pressly provides that &#8220;this covenant is independent of any other provi- sion in this agreement.&#8221; After B has begun work, A unjustifiably dis- charges him, and B thereupon en- gages in business in violation of the covenant. A&#8217;s employing B and B&#8217;s working for A are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. The quoted words indicate an in- tention that A&#8217;s employing B is not to be exchanged for B&#8217;s refraining from engaging in the same busi- ness. If the court concludes that this intention is clearly manifested, A has a claim against B for damages for breach of his promise not to com- pete.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy a machine, to be delivered im- mediately, for $10,000. As part of the same bargain, B gives A his ne- gotiable promissory note for $10,000 to A&#8217;s order, payable in 90 days, but the note makes no reference to the transaction out of which it arises. A fails to deliver the machine. A&#8217;s delivering the machine and B&#8217;s pay- ing the note are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. Therefore, under the rule stated in &#167; 237, A has no claim on the note or the contract against B. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 3&#8211;306, 3&#8211;408, and 3&#8211;307(3).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Promises taken collectively.</i> When the rule stated in this Section applies, all of the performances to be rendered by each party taken collec- tively are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. A court need not determine whether separate perfor- mances on either side are the subject of a single promise or of separate promises. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Nor need a court concern itself with the relationship among separate promises viewed as of the time of their making. Instead the court is to focus on the relative importance of the failure of performance in the light of the situa- tion of the parties at the time of that failure. See &#167;&#167; 237, 238, 241.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Performances need not be treated as equivalent.</i> When an ex- change consists exclusively of prom- ises, the values of the performances to be subsequently exchanged are usually regarded by the parties as equivalent. This is not always so since a party may make what is often called an &#8220;aleatory&#8221; promise, under which his duty to per- form is conditional on the occurrence of a fortuitous event. Or it may be un- derstood that the value of one party&#8217;s performance will be affected by chance, as where he promises to deliver his out- put or to pay during another&#8217;s lifetime. Even when one or both of the parties makes such a promise, however, they contemplate a subsequent exchange of performances, subject of course to the occurrence of the required conditions. Such cases are therefore subject to the rules stated in this Chapter (see &#167; 239), along with some special rules relating to the election of remedies which are stated in &#167;&#167; 378&#8211;80.</p>

During the month of January A unjustifi- ably rejects proper claims filed by B&#8217;s employees under the policy. B refuses to pay the premium on Feb- ruary 1. A&#8217;s paying proper claims of B&#8217;s employees and B&#8217;s paying the premium are to be exchanged under the exchange of promises. There- fore, under the rule stated in &#167; 237, if A&#8217;s breach is material, A has no claim against B.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 234. Order of Performances</b></p>

<p class="indent">(2) Except to the extent stated in Subsection (1), where the perfor- mance of only one party under such an exchange requires a period of time, his performance is due at an earlier time than that of the other party, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Advantages of simultaneous performance.</i> A requirement that the parties perform simultaneously where their performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises is fair for two reasons. First, it offers both parties maximum security against dis- appointment of their expectations of a subsequent exchange of performances by allowing each party to defer his own performance until he has been as- sured that the other will perform. This advantage is implemented by the rule stated in &#167; 238, which deals with offers to perform. Second, it avoids placing on either party the burden of financ- ing the other before the latter has per- formed. Subsection (1) therefore im- poses a requirement of simultaneous performance whenever this is feasible under the contract, in the absence of language or circumstances indicating a contrary intention. A notable exam- ple of such a requirement is that laid down for contracts for the sale of goods by Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;507 and 2&#8211;511. The requirement is subject to the agreement of the parties, as by an express provision extending credit to the buyer, or one requiring him to pay against documents or to furnish a letter of credit. Even absent an express provision, a contrary intention may be shown by circumstances includ- ing usage of trade and course of deal- ing (&#167;&#167; 221, 223; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1&#8211;205).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. When simultaneous perfor- mance possible under agreement.</i> In the absence of language or circum- stances showing a contrary intention, the requirement of simultaneous per- formance stated in Subsection (1) ap- plies whenever such performance is possible, consistent with the terms of the contract. A major instance where simultaneous performance is not pos- sible occurs when one party&#8217;s perfor- mance is continuous over some sub- stantial period of time, a situation that is dealt with in Subsection (2). How- ever, as is the case for the requirement of the preceding section that the whole performance be possible at one time, the requirement of simultaneous per- formance is not to be applied so literal- ly as to exclude instances in which the objectives of the requirement can be fulfilled although performance cannot be instantaneous. See Comment a to &#167; 233. A less important instance where simultaneous performance is not pos- sible occurs when distance and lack of adequate communications make it im- possible to assure the parties that per- formance is taking place at the same time, so that although the performance of each party can be instantaneous, the two performances cannot be simultane- ous within the meaning of Subsection (1). Cases in which simultaneous per- formance is possible under the terms of the contract can be grouped into five categories: (1) where the same time is fixed for the performance of each party; (2) where a time is fixed for the per- formance of one of the parties and no time is fixed for the other; (3) where no time is fixed for the performance of ei- ther party; (4) where the same period is fixed within which each party is to perform; (5) where different periods are fixed within which each party is to perform. The requirement of simulta- neous performance applies to the first four categories. The requirement does not apply to the fifth category, even if simultaneous performance is possible, because in fixing different periods for performance the parties must have contemplated the possibility of perfor- mance at different times under their agreement. Therefore in cases in the fifth category the circumstances show an intention contrary to the rule stated in Subsection (1).</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. When simultaneous perfor- mance possible in part.</i> The require- ment of simultaneous performance stated in Subsection (1) also applies where only part rather than all of the performance of one party can be per- formed simultaneously with either part or all of the performance of the other party. It therefore applies to the situations discussed in Comment b to &#167; 233 and exemplified by Illustration 3 to that section. But it is broader than this and also applies, for example, to in- stances where some part performance of one party can be rendered simulta- neously with the entire performance of the other party. See Comment f and Il- lustration 12.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. When simultaneous perfor- mance later becomes possible.</i> Although different times or periods were origi- nally fixed for the performance of each party, performance by the party who is to perform first may sometimes be delayed until the time for performance by the other party has arrived. If the latter party is entitled to and does as- sert that his remaining duties of per- formance are discharged because of the delay, under the rule stated in &#167; 237, no question of the order of performance re- mains. Unless the delay is justified, he will also have a claim for damages for total breach based on all of his remain- ing rights to performance. (&#167;&#167; 236(1), 243(1)). If, however, he is not entitled to assert that his remaining duties of performance are discharged, or if he does not assert this even though he is entitled to do so, a question of the order of performances remains. Unless the delay is justified he will, of course, have a claim for damages for partial breach because of the delay. Whether or not the delay is justified, he can at least in- sist on simultaneous performance. (As to judicial supervision of the require- ment of simultaneous performance where the injured party has brought an action before the time when his own performance is due and that time then <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>arrives before he has obtained and en- forced a judgment, see Comment c and Illustration 5 to &#167; 238.) There may be circumstances, however, in which it is appropriate for him to require the other party to perform first, as where the parties to a sale of goods contem- plate that the buyer will need the time specified between delivery and pay- ment to resell the goods in order to pay the price. In such a case the right of the party in delay to receive payment may be subject to postponement.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6, B duly pays the first three installments, but unjustifiably does not pay the fourth until the fifth is due. If B&#8217;s failure to pay the fourth installment discharges A&#8217;s remaining duties of performance under the rule stated in &#167; 237, A has a claim for damages for total breach (&#167; 243(1)), and no further performance is due from either party. Otherwise B&#8217;s failure to pay the fourth installment gives rise to only a claim for damages for partial breach because of the delay, and, unless circumstances make it appropriate for A to require B to pay the fourth installment first, de- livery of the deed and payment of the fourth and fifth installments are then due simultaneously.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Where performance requires a period of time.</i> Where the performance of one party requires a period of time and the performance of the other party does not, their performance can not be simultaneous. Since one of the parties must perform first, he must forego the security that a requirement of simul- taneous performance affords against disappointment of his expectation of an exchange of performances, and he must bear the burden of financing the other party before the latter has performed. See Comment a. Of course the parties can by express provision mitigate the harshness of a rule that requires that one completely perform before the oth- er perform at all. They often do this, for example, in construction contracts by stating a formula under which pay- ment is to be made at stated intervals as work progresses. But it is not fea- sible for courts to devise such formulas for the wide variety of such cases that come before them in which the parties have made no provision. Centuries ago, the principle became settled that where work is to be done by one party and payment is to be made by the other, the performance of the work must precede payment, in the absence of a showing of a contrary intention. It is sometimes supposed, that this principle grew out of employment contracts, and reflects a conviction that employers as a class are more likely to be responsible than are workmen paid in advance. Whether or not the explanation is correct, most parties today contract with reference to the principle, and unless they have evidenced a contrary intention it is at least as fair as the opposite rule would be.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Applicability of rule.</i> The rule stated in Subsection (2) usually finds its application to contracts involving services, such as construction and em- ployment contracts. The common prac- tice of making express provision for progress payments has diminished its importance with regard to the former, and the widespread enactment of state wage statutes giving the employee a right to the frequent periodic payment of wages has lessened its significance with regard to the latter. Nevertheless, it is a helpful rule for residual cases not otherwise provided for. It applies not only to contracts under which the per- formance of one party is more or less continuous, but also to contracts where performance consists of a series of acts with an interval of time between them. See Comment c. Under a contract of the latter type, simultaneity may be possible in part and, to the extent that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>it is possible, the rule stated in Subsec- tion (2) is subject to that stated in Sub- section (1).

<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Effect of non-occurrence of condition.</i> Under the rule stated in this Section, a material failure of per- formance, including defective perfor- mance as well as an absence of perfor- mance, operates as the non-occurrence of a condition. Under &#167; 225, the non- occurrence of a condition has two pos- sible effects on the duty subject to that condition. See Comment a to &#167; 225. The first is that of preventing performance of the duty from becoming due, at least temporarily (&#167; 225(1)). The second is that of discharging the duty when the condition can no longer occur (&#167; 225(2)). A material failure of performance has, under this Section, these effects on the other party&#8217;s remaining duties of per- formance with respect to the exchange. It prevents performance of those duties from becoming due, at least temporar- ily, and it discharges those duties if it has not been cured during the time in which performance can occur. The oc- currence of conditions of the type dealt with in this Section is required out of a sense of fairness rather than as a result of the agreement of the parties. Such conditions are therefore sometimes referred to as &#8220;constructive conditions of exchange.&#8221; Cf. &#167; 204. What is some- times referred to as &#8220;failure of consid- eration&#8221; by courts and statutes (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 3&#8211;408) is referred to in this Restatement as &#8220;fail- ure of performance&#8221; to avoid confusion with the absence of consideration. Cir- cumstances significant in determining whether a failure is material are set out in &#167; 241. Circumstances significant in determining the period of time after which remaining duties are discharged, if a material failure has not been cured, are set out in &#167; 242. The rules stated in this Section and the one following ap- ply without regard to whether or not the failure of performance is a breach. They apply, for example, even though the failure is justified on the ground of impracticability of performance (Chap- ter 11). Illustrations of the operation of these rules in situations in which the failure is justified are given in other chapters under the sections that deal with the particular justification, such as impracticability. See, e.g., &#167;&#167; 267, 268. The illustrations in this Chapter concern, for the most part, their opera- tion in situations where the failure is a breach. But see, e.g., Illustration 3. The rules of this Section and the one follow- ing apply even when the promise of the party in default is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, while the prom- ise of the other party is enforceable. See &#167; 140. They are, of course, subject to variation by agreement of the par- ties.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to build a house for B for $50,000, progress payments to be made monthly in an amount equal to 85% of the price of the work performed during the preceding month, the balance to be paid on the architect&#8217;s certifi- cate of satisfactory completion of the house. Without justification B fails to make a $5,000 progress pay- ment. A thereupon stops work on the house and a week goes by. A&#8217;s failure to continue the work is not a breach and B has no claim against A. B&#8217;s failure to make the progress payment is an uncured material failure of performance which op- erates as the non-occurrence of a condition of A&#8217;s remaining duties of performance under the exchange. If B offers to make the delayed pay- ment and in all the circumstances it is not too late to cure the mate- rial breach, A&#8217;s duties to continue the work are not discharged. A has a claim against B for damages for partial breach because of the delay.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, B fails to make the progress payment or to give any explanation or assurances <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>for one month. If, in all the circumstances, it is now too late for B to cure his material failure of performance by making the delayed payment, A&#8217;s duties to continue the work are discharged. Because B&#8217;s failure to make the progress pay- ment was a breach, A also has a claim against B for total breach of contract (&#167; 243).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A, a theater manager, con- tracts with B, an actress, for per- formance by her for a period of six months in a play that A is about to present. B dies during the first week of the performance. A&#8217;s remaining duties with respect to the exchange of performances are discharged by B&#8217;s uncured material failure of per- formance. Because B&#8217;s failure is jus- tified on the ground of impossibility (&#167; 262), A has no claim against B&#8217;s estate.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. First material failure of per- formance.</i> In many disputes over fail- ure of performance, both parties fail to finish performance, and the question is whether one of them is justified in so doing by the other party&#8217;s failure. (Compare Comment d.) This Section states the fundamental rule under which that question is to be answered. (The liability of the other party for damages for total breach is governed by the rule stated in &#167; 243.) The rule is based on the principle that where per- formances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises, each party is entitled to the assurance that he will not be called upon to perform his re- maining duties of performance with re- spect to the expected exchange if there has already been an uncured material failure of performance by the other par- ty. The central problem is in determin- ing which party is chargeable with the first uncured material failure of per- formance. In determining the relative times when performance is due, the terms of the agreement and the supple- mentary rules on time for performance should be considered (&#167;&#167; 233, 234). In determining whether there has been a failure of performance, the terms of the agreement and the supplementary rules such as those on omitted essen- tial terms (&#167; 204) and the duty of good faith and fair dealing (&#167; 205) should be considered. In determining whether a failure of performance is material, the circumstances listed in &#167; 241 should be considered. Even if the failure is ma- terial, it may still be possible to cure it by subsequent performance without a material failure. In the event of cure the injured party may still have a claim for any remaining non-performance as well as for any delay. In determining when it is too late to cure a failure of performance, the circumstances listed in &#167; 242 should be considered. In mak- ing all of these determinations the situ- ation of the parties is to be viewed as of the time for performance and in terms of the actual failure. If, for example, under the terms of the agreement the order of performance depends on an event subsequent to the time of the making of the contract, that event is to be taken into account.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy at a stated price four parcels of land which A does not own but which the parties expect A to ac- quire by purchase at a foreclosure sale. A bids on the four parcels at the foreclosure sale, but each time B bids against him and acquires all four for less than the contract price. A does not convey the four parcels to B. B has no claim against A. B&#8217;s bidding at the sale was a material breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing (&#167; 205), which operated as the non-occurrence of a condition of A&#8217;s duties and discharged them.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A, a contractor, and B, a subcontractor, make a contract un- der which B promises to install sew- er pipe in a trench which A is to dig <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and maintain during installation. A unjustifiably so fails to maintain the trench that it fills with water, severely hindering installation. B thereupon stops work and refuses to continue unless the breach is cured. A does not cure his breach. If A&#8217;s breach is material (&#167; 241), it oper- ates as the non-occurrence of a con- dition of B&#8217;s duty to build the sewer, discharging it, and A has no claim against B. If A&#8217;s breach is not mate- rial, B&#8217;s duties are not discharged, and B&#8217;s stopping work and refusing to continue is a breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A contracts to sell and B to buy on 30 days credit 3,000 tons of iron rails at a stated price. B pur- chases iron rails heavily from vari- ous sources for use in his business, and in consequences A has difficulty in securing 3,000 tons and the mar- ket price is substantially increased. A fails to deliver the rails. B has a claim against A for breach of con- tract. B&#8217;s purchase of iron rails from other sources for use in his business is not a failure of performance be- cause B is under no duty to refrain from purchasing for that purpose. A&#8217;s failure to deliver the rails is therefore a breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6, B mali- ciously buys iron rails heavily from various sources in order to prevent A from performing his contract with B. B has no claim against A. B&#8217;s ma- licious purchase of iron rails from other sources is material breach of his duty of good faith and fair deal- ing (&#167; 204), which operates as the non-occurrence of a condition of A&#8217;s duty to deliver the rails, discharg- ing it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Ignorance immaterial.</i> The non-occurrence of a condition of a par- ty&#8217;s duty has the effects stated in &#167; 225 even though that party does not know of its non-occurrence. See Comment e to &#167; 225. It follows that one party&#8217;s ma- terial failure of performance has the ef- fect of the non-occurrence of a condition of the other party&#8217;s remaining duties, under the rule stated in this Section, even though that other party does not know of the failure. If the other party is discharged as the result of an unjus- tified material failure of which he is ignorant, he has a claim for damages for total breach (&#167; 245). But any loss that he has suffered as a result of his own actions taken in ignorance of the breach cannot be recovered since his actions were not caused by the other&#8217;s breach. See Illustrations 8 and 9.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A party&#8217;s ignorance may, however, cause him to lose rights under rules other than the one stated in this sec- tion. He may, for example, be preclud- ed from relying on a condition where, through ignorance, he fails to make timely objection. So, under Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;608, a buyer of goods who accepts them in ignorance of their defects loses his right to insist upon strict performance as a condition of his duty to pay the price. Other rules may preclude a party from relying on a failure of performance as the non-oc- currence of a condition where, because of unreasonable ignorance, he has ac- cepted the other party&#8217;s performance or has given no reasons or the wrong rea- sons for its rejection. See, e.g., &#167;&#167; 246 and 248; Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;605, 2&#8211;607.</p>

After the service has begun, A, the employee, commits a material breach of his duty to give efficient service that would justify B in discharging him. B is not aware of this but discharges A for an in- adequate reason. A has no claim against B for discharging him. B has a claim against A for damages for total breach (&#167; 243) based on B&#8217;s loss due to A&#8217;s failure to give efficient <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>service up to the time of dis- charge, but not for damages based on the loss of A&#8217;s services after that time, because that loss was caused by B&#8217;s discharge of A and not by A&#8217;s failure to give efficient service.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A contracts to sell and B to buy goods on 30 days credit. A deliv- ers defective goods, which B rejects in ignorance of their defects. A has no claim against B. B has a claim against A for total breach (&#167; 243), but can recover nominal damages only since the unavailability of the goods to B was caused by B&#8217;s rejec- tion and not by their defects.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 9, when B rejects the goods he states an insuf- ficient reason, which induces a fail- ure by A to cure the defects in the goods. B is precluded from relying on the defects to justify his rejec- tion, not because of his ignorance itself, but because his giving of an insufficient reason for rejection ex- cused the non-occurrence of the con- dition of his duty to take and pay for the goods (&#167; 248; Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 2&#8211;605).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Substantial performance.</i> In an important category of disputes over failure of performance, one party asserts the right to payment on the ground that he has completed his per- formance, while the other party re- fuses to pay on the ground that there is an uncured material failure of per- formance. (Compare Comment b.) A typical example is that of the building contractor who claims from the owner payment of the unpaid balance under a construction contract. In such cases it is common to state the issue, not in terms of whether there has been an uncured material failure by the con- tractor, but in terms of whether there has been substantial performance by him. This manner of stating the issue does not change its substance, how- ever, and the rule stated in this Sec- tion also applies to such cases. If there has been substantial although not full performance, the building contractor has a claim for the unpaid balance and the owner has a claim only for dam- ages. If there has not been substantial performance, the building contractor has no claim for the unpaid balance, although he may have a claim in res- titution (&#167; 374). The considerations in determining whether performance is substantial are those listed in &#167; 241 for determining whether a failure is mate- rial. See Comment b to &#167; 241. If, how- ever, the parties have made an event a condition of their agreement, there is no mitigating standard of materiality or substantiality applicable to the non- occurrence of that event. If, therefore, the agreement makes full performance a condition, substantial performance is not sufficient and if relief is to be had under the contract, it must be through excuse of the non-occurrence of the con- dition to avoid forfeiture. See &#167; 229 and Illustration 1 to that section.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">11. A contracts to build a house for B, for which B promises to pay $50,000 in monthly progress pay- ments equal to 85% of the value of the work with the balance to be paid on completion. When A completes construction, B refuses to pay the $7,500 balance claiming that there are defects that amount to an un- cured material breach. If the breach is material, A&#8217;s performance is not substantial and he has no claim un- der the contract against B, although he may have a claim in restitution (&#167; 374). If the breach is not materi- al, A&#8217;s performance is said to be sub- stantial, he has a claim under the contract against B for $7,500, and B has a claim against A for damages because of the defects.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Duties affected.</i> Under the rule stated in this Section, only duties with <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>respect to the performances to be ex- changed under the particular exchange of promises are affected by a failure of one of those performances. A duty un- der a separate contract is not affected (see Comment d to &#167; 231 and Illustra- tion 5 to that section), nor is a duty under the same contract affected if it was not one to render a performance to be exchanged under an exchange of promises (see Illustrations 3 and 4 to &#167; 232). Furthermore, only duties to ren- der performance are affected. A claim for damages that has already arisen as a result of a claim for partial breach is not discharged under the rule stated in this Section.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 238. Effect on Other Party&#8217;s Duties of a Failure to Offer Performance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where all or part of the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises are due simultaneously, it is a condition of each party&#8217;s duties to render such performance that the other party either render or, with manifested present ability to do so, offer performance of his part of the simultaneous exchange.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Effect of offer to perform.</i> Where the performances are to be ex- changed simultaneously under an ex- change of promises, each party is en- titled to refuse to proceed with that simultaneous exchange until he is rea- sonably assured that the other party will perform at the same time. If a par- ty actually performs, his performance both discharges his own duty (&#167; 235(1)) and amounts to the occurrence of a con- dition of the other party&#8217;s duty (&#167; 237). But it is not necessary that he actually perform in order to produce this lat- ter effect. It is enough that he make an appropriate offer to perform, since it is a condition of each party&#8217;s duties of performance with respect to the ex- change that there be no uncured mate- rial failure by the other party at least to offer performance. Circumstances significant in determining whether a failure is material are set out in &#167; 241. Such an offer of performance by a party amounts to the occurrence of a condi- tion of the other party&#8217;s duty to ren- der performance, although it does not amount to performance by the former. Until a party has at least made such an offer, however, the other party is under no duty to perform, and if both par- ties fail to make such an offer, neither party&#8217;s failure is a breach. (If one of the parties is already in breach, as where he has repudiated or has failed to go to the place appointed for the simultane- ous exchange, the other party&#8217;s duty to render performance may already have been discharged under &#167;&#167; 253(2) or 237, giving him a claim for damages for total breach under &#167;&#167; 253(1) or 243(1).) When it is too late for either to make such an offer, both parties are dis- charged by the non-occurrence of a con- dition. A failure to offer performance can be cured, if an appropriate offer is made in time (&#167; 242). Cf. Comment b to &#167; 237. The fact that a party is ignorant of a defect in the other party&#8217;s offer is immaterial. See Comment c to &#167; 237.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to sell and B to buy a machine for $10,000, de- livery of the machine and payment of the price to be made at a stated place on July 1. On July 1 both par- ties are present at that place, but A neither delivers nor offers to deliver the machine and B neither pays nor offers to pay the price. A has no claim against B, and B has no claim against A. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;507(1) and 2&#8211;511(1). If, however, B had committed a mate- rial breach by failing to go to the stated place, A would have had a claim against B for damages for to- tal breach. See &#167;&#167; 237, 243.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, on July 2, B, with manifested present abil- ity to do so, offers to pay the price if A simultaneously delivers the machine, but A refuses to deliver the machine. If the delay of one day does not exceed the time after which A is discharged (&#167; 242), A&#8217;s refusal is a breach. If it exceeds that time, B has no claim against A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. What amounts to an offer to perform.</i> An offer of performance meets the requirement stated in this Section even though it is conditional on simul- taneous performance by the other par- ty. The offer must be accompanied with manifested present ability to make it good, but the offeror need not go so far as actually to hold out that which he is to deliver. (On the meaning of the term &#8220;manifested,&#8221; see Comment b to &#167; 2.) Thus the Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;503(1) requires only &#8220;that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer&#8217;s disposition and give the buyer any notice reasonably necessary to en- able him to take delivery.&#8221; In this re- spect the requirement of this Section is less exacting than that of tender under, for example, &#167; 45 or &#167; 62. Any conduct, including tender, that goes beyond an offer of performance will, of course, also satisfy the requirement. The re- quirement of an offer of performance is to be applied in the light of what is reasonably to be expected by the par- ties in view of the practical difficulties of absolute simultaneity (see Comment b to &#167; 234) and is subject to the agree- ment of the parties, as supplemented or qualified by usage (&#167;&#167; 221, 222) and course of dealing (&#167; 223).</p>

A, in the presence of B and C, makes a conditional offer of a deed of the property subject to the mortgage, and both A and C present docu- ments that are legally sufficient to satisfy the mortgage debt to be de- livered immediately on payment of the price by B. B thereupon refuses to pay the price. In view of the cir- cumstances at the time the contract was made, A&#8217;s offer is sufficient, and A has a claim against B for damages for total breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Judicial supervision.</i> In an action for specific performance or for the price, a court may ensure that the party seeking relief makes an offer of performance that meets the require- ments of this Section by granting relief conditional on such an offer. Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;709(2), for ex- ample, provides that &#8220;where the seller sues for the price, he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been iden- tified to the contract and are still in his control&#8221; See Illustration 4. See also Comment a to &#167; 358 with respect to specific performance. If performances, although not originally due simultane- ously, have become due simultaneously after the commencement of the action <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>because the earlier performance has been delayed, the granting of such re- lief is equally appropriate. Even though the performances do not become due si- multaneously until after judgment, the court may exercise its power on either the defendant&#8217;s request or on its own motion. See Illustration 5.</p>

The standard of materiality applies to contracts of all types and without regard to whether the whole performance of either party is to be rendered at one time or part performances are to be rendered at dif- ferent times. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;612. It also applies to pairs of agreed equivalents under &#167; 240. See Illustration 2. It is to be applied in the light of the facts of each case in such a way as to further the purpose of se- curing for each party his expectation of an exchange of performances. This Section therefore states circumstances, not rules, which are to be considered in determining whether a particular fail- ure is material. A determination that a failure is not material means only that it does not have the effect of the non- occurrence of a condition under &#167;&#167; 237 and 238. Even if not material, the fail- ure may be a breach and give rise to a claim for damages for partial breach (&#167;&#167; 236, 243).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a subcontractor, con- tracts to do excavation and earth moving on a housing subdivision project for B, the owner and gen- eral contractor, and to do all work &#8220;in a workmanlike manner.&#8221; B is to make monthly progress payments for the work performed during the preceding month less a retainer of ten percent. A negligently damages a building with his bulldozer caus- ing serious damage and denies any liability for B&#8217;s loss. When B refuses to make further progress payments until A repairs the damage or ad- mits liability, A notifies B that he cancels the contract. If the court determines that A&#8217;s breach is mate- rial, A has no claim against B. B has a claim against A for damages for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6 to &#167; 240, A completes the part concerned with the excavation and grading of lots and streets but fails in a minor respect to comply with the specifi- cations. If a court determines that the failure is not material, A has a claim against B for $75,000 under the contract for the excavation and grading. B has a claim for damages against A for his failure fully to per- form as to excavation and grading and also for his unjustified refusal to make street improvements.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Loss of benefit to injured party.</i> Since the purpose of the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 237 and 238 is to secure the parties&#8217; expectation of an exchange of perfor- mances, an important circumstance in determining whether a failure is mate- rial is the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>exchange (Subsection (a)). If the consid- eration given by either party consists partly of some performance and only partly of a promise (see Comment a to &#167; 232), regard must be had to the entire exchange, including that performance, in applying this criterion. Although the relationship between the monetary loss to the injured party as a result of the failure and the contract price may be significant, no simple rule based on the ratio of the one to the other can be laid down, and here, as elsewhere under this Section, all relevant circumstances must be considered. In construction contracts, for example, defects affect- ing structural soundness are ordinar- ily regarded as particularly significant. In the sale of goods a particularly ex- acting standard has evolved. There it has long been established that, in the absence of a showing of a contrary in- tention, a buyer is entitled to expect strict performance of the contract, and Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;601 carries forward this expectation by al- lowing the buyer to reject &#8220;if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any re- spect to conform to the contract.&#8221; The Code, however, compensates to some extent for the severity of this standard by extending the seller&#8217;s right to cure beyond the point when the time for per- formance has expired in some instanc- es (&#167; 2&#8211;508(2)), by allowing revocation of acceptance only if a nonconformity &#8220;substantially impairs&#8221; the value of the goods to the buyer (&#167; 2&#8211;608(1)), and by allowing the injured party to treat a nonconformity or default as to one installment under an installment con- tract as a breach of the whole only if it &#8220;substantially impairs&#8221; the value of the whole (&#167; 2&#8211;612(3)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Adequacy of compensation for loss.</i> The second circumstance, the ex- tent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for his loss of benefit (Subsection (b)), is a corollary of the first. Difficulty that he may have in proving with sufficient certainty the amount of that loss will affect the ad- equacy of compensation. If the failure is a breach, the injured party always has a claim for damages, and the ques- tion becomes one of the adequacy of that claim to compensate him for the lost benefit. Where the failure is not a breach, the question becomes one of the adequacy of any claim, such as one in restitution, to which the injured party may be entitled. This is a particularly important circumstance when the par- ty in breach seeks specific performance. Such relief may be granted if damages can adequately compensate the injured party for the defect in performance. See Comment c to &#167; 242.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Forfeiture by party who fails.</i> Because a material failure acts as the non-occurrence of a condition, the same risk of forfeiture obtains as in the case of conditions generally if the party who fails to perform or tender has relied substantially on the expectation of the exchange, as through preparation or performance. Therefore a third circum- stance is the extent to which the party failing to perform or to make an offer to perform will suffer forfeiture if the fail- ure is treated as material. For this rea- son a failure is less likely to be regarded as material if it occurs late, after sub- stantial preparation or performance, and more likely to be regarded as ma- terial if it occurs early, before such reli- ance. For the same reason the failure is more likely to be regarded as mate- rial if such preparation or performance as has taken place can be returned to and salvaged by the party failing to perform or tender, and less likely to be regarded as material if it cannot. These factors argue against a finding of mate- rial failure and in favor of one of sub- stantial performance where a builder has completed performance under a construction contract and, because the building is on the owner&#8217;s land, can sal- vage nothing if he is denied recovery of the balance of the price. Even in such a case, however, the potential forfeiture <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>may be mitigated if the builder has a claim in restitution (&#167;&#167; 370&#8211;77, especially &#167; 374) or if he has already re- ceived progress payments under a pro- vision of the contract. The same factors argue for a finding of material failure where a seller tenders goods and can salvage them by resale to others if they are rejected and he is denied recovery of the price. This helps to explain the severity of the rule as applied to the sale of goods. See Comment b. Even in such a case, however, the potential for- feiture may be aggravated if the seller has manufactured the goods specially for the buyer or has spent substantial sums in shipment.</p>

B re- fuses to accept or pay for the onions when they are tendered. Under the circumstances stated in Subsec- tions (a) and (c), A&#8217;s failure is mate- rial and A has no claim against B. If A&#8217;s failure is unjustified, B has a claim against A for damages for partial breach because of the delay even if A cures his failure, and has a claim against A for damages for total breach if A does not cure his failure (&#167; 243).</p>

Under the circumstances stated in Subsec- tions (a), (b), and (c), the failure of performance is material and A has no claim against B. If A&#8217;s failure is unjustified, B has a claim against A for damages for partial breach be- cause of the delay even if A cures his failure, and has a claim against A for damages for total breach if A does not cure his failure (&#167; 243).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Uncertainty.</i> A material fail- ure by one party gives the other party the right to withhold further perfor- mance as a means of securing his expec- tation of an exchange of performances. To the extent that that expectation is already reasonably secure, in spite of the failure, there is less reason to con- clude that the failure is material. The likelihood that the failure will be cured is therefore a significant circumstance in determining whether it is material (Subsection (d)). The fact that the in- jured party already has some security for the other party&#8217;s performance ar- gues against a determination that the failure is material. So do reasonable as- surances of performance given by the other party after his failure. So does a shift in the market that makes perfor- mance of the contract more favorable to the other party. On the other hand, defaults by the other party under other contracts or as to other installments under the same contract argue for a determination of materiality. So does such financial weakness of the other party as suggests an inability to cure. This circumstance differs from the notion of reasonable grounds for inse- curity (&#167; 251), in that the former can become relevant only after there has been an actual failure to perform or to tender. On discharge by repudiation, see &#167; 253(2).</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Absence of good faith or fair dealing.</i> A party&#8217;s adherence to stan- dards of good faith and fair dealing (&#167; 205) will not prevent his failure to perform a duty from amounting to a breach (&#167; 236(2)). Nor will his adher- ence to such standards necessarily pre- vent his failure from having the effect of the non-occurrence of a condition (&#167; 237; cf. &#167; 238). The extent to which the behavior of the party failing to per- form or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing is, however, a significant cir- cumstance in determining whether the failure is material (Subsection (e)). In giving weight to this factor courts have often used such less precise terms as &#8220;wilful.&#8221; Adherence to the standards stated in Subsection (e) is not conclu- sive, since other circumstances may cause a failure to be material in spite of such adherence. Nor is non-adherence conclusive, and other circumstances may cause a failure not to be material in spite of such non-adherence.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 242. Circumstances Significant in Determining When Remaining Duties Are Discharged</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In determining the time after which a party&#8217;s uncured material failure to render or to offer performance discharges the other party&#8217;s remaining duties <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to render performance under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 237 and 238, the following circumstances are significant:</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) the extent to which it reasonably appears to the injured party that delay may prevent or hinder him in making reasonable substitute arrangements;</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Cure.</i> Under &#167;&#167; 237 and 238, a party&#8217;s uncured material failure to perform or to offer to perform not only has the effect of suspending the other party&#8217;s duties (&#167; 225(1)) but, when it is too late for the performance or the of- fer to perform to occur, the failure also has the effect of discharging those du- ties (&#167; 225(2)). Ordinarily there is some period of time between suspension and discharge, and during this period a party may cure his failure. Even then, since any breach gives rise to a claim, a party who has cured a material breach has still committed a breach, by his de- lay, for which he is liable in damages. Furthermore, in some instances timely performance is so essential that any delay immediately results in discharge and there is no period of time during which the injured party&#8217;s duties are merely suspended and the other party can cure his failure.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Significant circumstances.</i> This Section states circumstances which are to be considered in determin- ing whether there is still time to cure a particular failure, or whether the pe- riod of time for discharge has expired. They are similar to the circumstances stated in the preceding section. The im- portance of delay to the injured party will depend on the extent to which it will deprive him of the benefit which he reasonably expected (&#167; 241(a)) and on the extent to which he can be adequate- ly compensated (&#167; 241(b)). The extent of the forfeiture by the party failing to perform or to offer to perform (&#167; 241(c)) is also significant in determining the importance of delay. The likelihood that the injured party&#8217;s withholding of performance will induce the other party to cure his failure is particularly important (&#167; 241(d)), because the very reason for suspending rather than immediately discharging the injured party&#8217;s duties is that this will induce cure. The reasonableness of the injured party&#8217;s conduct in communicating his grievances and in seeking satisfaction is a factor to be considered in this con- nection. Where performance is to ex- tend over a period of time, as where de- livery of goods is to be in installments, so that a continuing relationship be- tween the parties is contemplated, the injured party may be expected to give more opportunity for cure than in the case of an isolated exchange. On dis- charge by repudiation, see &#167; 253(2). Finally, the nature of the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform may be considered here as under the preceding section (&#167; 241(e)).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1 to &#167; 237, B tenders the progress payment after a two-day delay along with <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>damages for the delay. A refuses to accept the payment and resume work and notifies B that he cancels the contract. B&#8217;s tender cured his breach before A&#8217;s remaining duties to render performance were dis- charged, and B has a claim against A for total breach of contract, sub- ject to a claim by A against B for damages for partial breach because of the delay.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Substitute arrangements.</i> It is often said that in commercial trans- actions, notably those for the sale of goods, prompt performance by a party is essential if he is to be allowed to re- quire the other to perform or, as it is sometimes put, &#8220;time is of the essence.&#8221; The importance of prompt delivery by a seller of goods generally derives from the circumstance that goods, as contrasted for example with land, are particularly likely to be subject to rapid fluctuations in market price. There- fore, even a relatively short delay in a rising market may adversely affect the buyer by causing a sharp increase in the cost of &#8220;cover.&#8221; See Uniform Com- mercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;712, 2&#8211;713. A less rigid standard applies to contracts for the sale of goods to be delivered in in- stallments or to be specially manufac- tured for the buyer. On the other hand, considerable delay does not preclude enforcement of a contract for the sale of land if damages are adequate to com- pensate for the delay and there are no special circumstances indicating that prompt performance was essential and no express provision requiring such performance. But these are all merely particular applications of a more gen- eral principle. Subsection (b) states that principle. Under any contract, the extent to which it reasonably appears to the injured party that delay may prevent or hinder him from making reasonable substitute arrangements is a consideration in determining the effect of delay. Cf. &#167; 241(a), (b). As in the case of &#167; 241 (see Comment c), a party in breach who seeks specific per- formance may be granted relief with compensation for the delay, in circum- stances where he would have no claim for damages.</p>

B recovers at the end of ten days and offers to per- form the remainder of the contract, but A refuses. Whether B&#8217;s failure to render performance due to illness immediately discharges A&#8217;s remain- ing duties of performance, instead of merely suspending them, depends on the circumstances stated in Sub- section (b) and in &#167; 241(b) and (d), and in particular on the possibility as it reasonably appears to A when B becomes ill of the illness being only temporary and of A&#8217;s obtaining an adequate temporary substitute.</p>

Under the circumstances stated in Subsection (b) and in &#167; 241(a) and (c), the pe- riod of time has passed after which B&#8217;s remaining duties to render per- formance are discharged because of A&#8217;s material breach and A therefore has no claim against B.

Under the circumstances stated in Subsections (b) and (c) and in &#167; 241(a), in the absence of special circumstances, the period of time has not passed after which B&#8217;s remaining duties to render per- formance are discharged. Although A&#8217;s breach is material, it has been cured. A has a claim against B for damages for total breach of contract, subject to a claim by B against A for damages for partial breach because of the delay.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A agrees to sell and B to buy land, the transfer to be on Feb- ruary 1.

A replies that unless B tenders the price immediately he will not deliver the deed. On Feb- ruary 15, B sues for specific perfor- mance, offering in his pleading to pay the agreed price with interest to compensate A for the delay. In the circumstances stated in Subsec- tion (b) and in &#167; 241(a), (b), and (d), the period of time has not passed after which A&#8217;s remaining duties to render performance are discharged. Although B&#8217;s breach is material, the court may decree specific perfor- mance subject to B&#8217;s tender of the price and payment by B of damages for partial breach to compensate A for the delay.</p>

B notifies A that he refuses to take or pay for the fourth delivery and that he cancels the contract. Whether the period of time has passed after which B&#8217;s remaining duties to render perfor- mance are discharged, so that B&#8217;s notification is not a repudiation, de- pends on the circumstances stated in Subsection (b) and in &#167; 241(a), (b), (d), and (e).

The market price for iron is falling and B gives no assurances or expla- nation for the delay. On the twenti- eth of the month A notifies B that he will make no further deliveries and that he cancels the contract. Whether the period of time has passed after which A&#8217;s remaining duties to render performance are discharged, so that A&#8217;s notification is not a repudiation, depends on the circumstances stated in Subsec- tion (b) and in &#167; 241(a), (b), (d), and (e). See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;612.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Effect of agreement.</i> The agreement of the parties often contains a provision for the time of performance or tender. It may simply provide for performance on a stated date. In that event, a material breach on that date entitles the injured party to withhold his performance and gives him a claim for damages for delay, but it does not of itself discharge the other party&#8217;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>remaining duties. Only if the circum- stances, viewed as of the time of the breach, indicate that performance or tender on that day is of genuine impor- tance are the injured party&#8217;s remain- ing duties discharged immediately, with no period of time during which they are merely suspended. It is, of course, open to the parties to make per- formance or tender by a stated date a condition by their agreement, in which event, absent excuse (see Comment b to &#167; 225 and Comment c to &#167; 229), delay beyond that date results in discharge (&#167; 225(2)). Such stock phrases as &#8220;time is of the essence&#8221; do not necessarily have this effect, although under Sub- section (c) they are to be considered along with other circumstances in de- termining the effect of delay.</p>

Excuse of non-occurrence of condition.</i> Where a duty of one party is subject to the occurrence of a condi- tion, the additional duty of good faith and fair dealing imposed on him under &#167; 205 may require some cooperation on his part, either by refraining from conduct that will prevent or hinder the occurrence of that condition or by taking affirmative steps to cause its occurrence. Under &#167; 235(2), non-perfor- mance of that duty when performance is due is a breach. See Illustration 3 to &#167; 235. Under this Section it has the further effect of excusing the non-oc- currence of the condition itself, so that performance of the duty that was origi- nally subject to its occurrence can be- come due in spite of its non-occurrence. See Comments b and c to &#167; 225. The rule stated in this Section only applies, however, where the lack of cooperation constitutes a breach, either of a duty imposed by the terms of the agree- ment itself or of a duty imposed by a term supplied by the court. There is no breach if the risk of such a lack of cooperation was assumed by the other party or if the lack of cooperation is jus- tifiable.</p>

A has a claim against B for $20,000. B&#8217;s breach of his duty of good faith and fair deal- ing contributed materially to the non-occurrence of the condition, the issuance of the certificate, excusing it. Cf.

C has a claim against A <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>for $5,000, less any expenses that C saved because the sale was not con- summated.

A has a claim against B for total breach of contract. B&#8217;s breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing contributed materially to the non-occurrence of the condition, approval of the application, excus- ing it. Cf.

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy A&#8217;s rights as one of three les- sees under a mining lease in Indian lands. The contract states that it is &#8220;subject only to approval by the Sec- retary of the Interior,&#8221; which is re- quired by statute. B files a request for approval but A fails to support B&#8217;s request by giving necessary co- operation. Approval is denied and A cannot convey his rights. B has a claim against A for total breach of contract. A&#8217;s breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing contrib- uted materially to the non-occur- rence of the condition, approval by the Secretary of the Interior, excus- ing it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Contribute materially.</i> Al- though it is implicit in the rule that the condition has not occurred, it is not necessary to show that it would have occurred but for the lack of coopera- tion. It is only required that the breach have contributed materially to the non-occurrence. Nevertheless, if it can be shown that the condition would not have occurred regardless of the lack of cooperation, the failure of performance did not contribute materially to its non- occurrence and the rule does not apply. The burden of showing this is properly thrown on the party in breach.</p>

Four years after their marriage, A shoots both B and himself. B dies instantly and A dies the following day. B&#8217;s estate has a claim against A&#8217;s es- tate for $100,000. A&#8217;s breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing contributed materially to the non- occurrence of the condition, B&#8217;s surviving A, excusing it. The fact that B&#8217;s estate cannot show that B would otherwise have survived A does not prevent it from recovering the $100,000. Compare the rule on certainty in &#167; 352.</p>

B is to pay A $500,000 plus a bonus of $100,000 if the profits from the plant exceed a stated amount during the first year of its operation. Six months after the transfer B sells the plant to C, who dismantles it. B refuses to pay the bonus. Whether A has a claim against B depends on whether B&#8217;s failure to operate the plant for a year is a breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing which contrib- uted materially to the non-occur- rence of the condition, the profits exceeding the stated amount during the first year, excusing it. The fact that A cannot show that the prof- its would otherwise have exceeded the stated amount does not prevent him from recovering. If, however, B shows that they would not have exceeded that amount, A cannot <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>recover. Compare the rule on cer- tainty in &#167; 352.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 4, A shows that even if he had given his coop- eration, the Secretary of the Inte- rior would have withheld approval on other grounds. B has no claim against A for breach of contract. A&#8217;s breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing did not contribute ma- terially to the non-occurrence of the condition, and its non-occurrence is not excused.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Exceptions.</i> Under &#167;&#167; 237 and 238, it may be required as a condition of one party&#8217;s duty that the other party perform or offer to perform his duty. A breach by the first party of his duty of good faith and fair dealing will, if ma- terial and not cured in time, discharge that duty of the other party (&#167; 237), eliminating the requirement that the other party perform or offer to perform it. The discharge of the duty has the additional effect of excusing the non- occurrence of the condition. But non- occurrence of the condition is excused only if the duty is discharged. The rule stated in this Section is, therefore, not applicable to such situations. See Illus- trations 4, 5, and 7 to &#167; 237.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Consequences of repudiation.</i> A statement by a party to the other that he will not or cannot perform without a breach, or a voluntary affir- mative act that renders him unable or apparently unable to perform without a breach may impair the value of the contract to the other party. It may have several consequences under this Re- statement. If it accompanies a breach by non-performance that would other- wise give rise to only a claim for dam- ages for partial breach, it may give rise to a claim for damages for total breach instead (&#167; 243). Even if it occurs before any breach by non-performance, it may give rise to a claim for damages for total breach (&#167; 253(1)), discharge the other party&#8217;s duties (&#167; 253(2)), or ex- cuse the non-occurrence of a condition (&#167; 255).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Nature of statement.</i> In order to constitute a repudiation, a party&#8217;s language must be sufficiently positive to be reasonably interpreted to mean that the party will not or cannot per- form. Mere expression of doubt as to his willingness or ability to perform is not enough to constitute a repudia- tion, although such an expression may give an obligee reasonable grounds to believe that the obligor will commit a serious breach and may ultimately result in a repudiation under the rule stated in &#167; 251. However, language that under a fair reading &#8220;amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract&#8221; constitutes a repudiation. Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;610. Language that is accom- panied by a breach by non-performance may amount to a repudiation even though, standing alone, it would not be sufficiently positive. See &#167; 243(2). The statement must be made to an obligee under the contract, including a third party beneficiary or an assignee.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. On April 1, A contracts to sell and B to buy land, delivery of <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the deed and payment of the price to be on July 30. On May 1, A tells B that he will not perform. A&#8217;s state- ment is a repudiation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to build a house for B for $50,000, progress payments to be made monthly in an amount equal to 85% of the price of the work performed during the preceding month, the balance to be paid on the architect&#8217;s certificate of satisfactory completion of the house. Without justification B fails to make a $5,000 progress payment and tells A that because of financial difficulties he will be unable to pay him anything for at least another month. If, after a month, it would be too late for B to cure his material failure of performance by making the delayed payment, B&#8217;s statement is a repudiation. See Illustration 2 to &#167; 237.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A does not tell B that he will not perform but says, &#8220;I am not sure that I can perform, and I do not intend to do so unless I am legally bound to.&#8221; A&#8217;s statement is not a repudiation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. The facts being otherwise as in Illustration 1, A tells C, a third person having no right under the contract, and not B, that he will not perform. C informs B of this conver- sation, although not requested by A to do so. A&#8217;s statement is not a repu- diation. But see Comments b and c to &#167; 251.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Nature of act.</i> In order to con- stitute a repudiation, a party&#8217;s act must be both voluntary and affirmative, and must make it actually or apparently impossible for him to perform. An act that falls short of these requirements may, however, give reasonable grounds to believe that the obligor will commit a serious breach for the purposes of the rule stated in &#167; 251. The effect of bankruptcy is governed in large part by federal law. In liquidation cases, for example, Bankruptcy Reform Act &#167; 365(a), (d) and (e) gives the trustee the power to assume or reject an execu- tory contract within a statutory period, and the obligee must give him the time to exercise this power. A contract not assumed during this period is deemed to be rejected. Under Bankruptcy Re- form Act &#167; 365(g)(1), notwithstanding state law, the trustee&#8217;s rejection of a contract &#8220;constitutes a breach of such contract immediately before the date of the filing of the petition&#8221; The rules stated in this Restatement apply to the extent that they are consistent with federal bankruptcy law.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">5. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A says nothing to B on May 1, but on that date he contracts to sell the land to C. A&#8217;s making of the contract with C is a repudiation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A says nothing to B on May 1, but on that date he mortgages the land to C as security for a $40,000 loan which is not payable until one year later. A&#8217;s mortgaging the land is a repu- diation. Compare Illustration 4 to &#167; 251.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A contracts to employ B, and B to work for A, the employ- ment to last a year beginning in ten days. Three days after making the contract B embarks on a ship for a voyage around the world. B&#8217;s em- barking for the voyage is a repudia- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Gravity of threatened breach.</i> In order for a statement or an act to be a repudiation, the threatened breach must be of sufficient gravity that, if the breach actually occurred, it would of itself give the obligee a claim for dam- ages for total breach under &#167; 243(1). Generally, a party acts at his peril if, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>insisting on what he mistakenly be- lieves to be his rights, he refuses to perform his duty. His statement is a repudiation if the threatened breach would, without more, have given the injured party a claim for damages for total breach. Modern procedural devic- es, such as the declaratory judgment, may be used to mitigate the harsh re- sults that might otherwise result from this rule. Furthermore, if the threat- ened breach would not itself have given the injured party a claim for damages for total breach, the statement or vol- untary act that threatens it is not a repudiation. But where a party wrong- fully states that he will not perform at all unless the other party consents to a modification of his contract rights, the statement is a repudiation even though the concession that he seeks is a minor one, because the breach that he threat- ens in order to exact it is a complete refusal of performance.</p>

On June 1, A tells B that he will not deliver a deed until August 1. A&#8217;s statement is not a repudiation unless the one-day delay would, in the absence of a repudiation, have given B a claim for damages for total breach. See Illustration 4 to &#167; 242.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 8, A tells B that he will not deliver a deed at all unless B agrees to accept it on August 1. A&#8217;s statement is a repu- diation. The result is the same even though A acts in the erroneous be- lief that the modification has no le- gal effect.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 251. When a Failure to Give Assurance May Be Treated as a Repudiation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where reasonable grounds arise to believe that the obligor will commit a breach by non-performance that would of itself give the obligee a claim for damages for total breach under &#167; 243, the obligee may demand adequate assurance of due performance and may, if reasonable, suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed ex- change until he receives such assurance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The obligee may treat as a repudiation the obligor&#8217;s failure to pro- vide within a reasonable time such assurance of due performance as is adequate in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> Ordinarily an obli- gee has no right to demand reassur- ance by the obligor that the latter will perform when his performance is due. However, a contract &#8220;imposes an obli- gation on each party that the other&#8217;s expectation of receiving due perfor- mance will not be impaired.&#8221; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;609(1). When, therefore, an obligee reasonably be- lieves that the obligor will commit a breach by non-performance that would of itself give him a claim for damages for total breach (&#167; 243), he may, under the rule stated in this Section, be en- titled to demand assurance of perfor- mance. The rule is a generalization, applicable without regard to the sub- ject matter of the contract, from that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;609. The latter applies only to contracts for the sale of goods and gives a party a right to adequate assurance of perfor- mance where &#8220;reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance&#8221; of the other party. Both rules rest on the principle that the par- ties to a contract look to actual perfor- mance &#8220;and that a continuing sense of reliance and security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due, is an important feature of the bargain.&#8221; Comment 1 to Uniform Com- mercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;609. This principle is closely related to the duty of good faith and fair dealing in the performance of the contract (&#167; 205). See also Comment b to &#167; 141. The rule stated in this Sec- tion may be modified by agreement of the parties&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Relation to other rules.</i> An obli- gee who believes, for whatever reason, that the obligor will not or cannot per- form without a breach, is always free to act on that belief. If he is not himself under a duty to perform before the ob- ligor, he may simply await the obligor&#8217;s performance and, if his belief is con- firmed, he will have a claim for dam- ages for breach by non-performance. If he can prove that his belief would have been confirmed, he is at least shielded from liability even if he has failed to give a performance that is due before that of the obligor or has, by making alternative arrangements, done an act that amounts to a repudiation. For ex- ample, under &#167; 254, the obligee&#8217;s duty to pay damages for total breach by re- pudiation is discharged if the obligor himself would not or could not have performed when his performance was due. If, however, the obligee&#8217;s belief is incorrect, his own failure to perform or his making of alternate arrangements may subject him to a claim for damages for total breach. This Section affords him an opportunity, in appropriate cases, to demand assurance of due per- formance and thereby avoid the uncer- tainties that would otherwise inhere in acting on his belief. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Reasonable grounds for belief.</i> Whether &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221; have arisen for an obligee&#8217;s belief that there will be a breach must be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. The grounds for his belief must have arisen after the time when the contract was made and cannot be based on facts known to him at that time. Nor, since the grounds must be reasonable, can they be based on events that occurred after that time but as to which he took the risk when he made the contract. But minor breaches may give reasonable grounds for a belief that there will be more seri- ous breaches, and the mere failure of the obligee to press a claim for dam- ages for those minor breaches will not preclude him from basing a demand for assurances on them. Compare &#167; 241(d), Comment e to that section, and Com- ment b to &#167; 242. Even circumstances that do not relate to the particular con- tract, such as defaults under other con- tracts, may give reasonable grounds for such a belief. See Comment a to &#167; 252. Conduct by a party that indicates his doubt as to his willingness or ability to perform but that is not sufficiently pos- itive to amount to a repudiation (see Comment b to &#167; 250), may give rea- sonable grounds for such a belief. And events that indicate a party&#8217;s apparent inability, but do not amount to a repu- diation because they are not voluntary acts, may also give reasonable grounds for such a belief. &#8230; [I]n order for this Section to apply, the breach that the obligee believes the obligor will commit must be a breach by non-performance that would so substantially impair the value of the contract to the obligee that it would of itself, unaccompanied by a repudiation, give him a claim for dam- ages for total breach under &#167; 243. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Nature and time of assurance.</i> Whether an assurance of due perfor- mance is &#8220;adequate&#8221; depends on what <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>it is reasonable to require in a particu- lar case taking account of the circum- stances of that case. The relationship between the parties, any prior dealings that they have had, the reputation of the party whose performance has been called into question, the nature of the grounds for insecurity, and the time within which the assurance must be furnished are all relevant factors. (If the obligor&#8217;s insolvency constitutes the grounds for the obligee&#8217;s insecurity, the special rule stated in &#167; 252 empowers him to suspend performance until he receives assurance in the form of actual performance, an offer of performance, or reasonable security.) What is a &#8220;rea- sonable time&#8221; within which to give as- surance under Subsection (2) will also depend on the particular circumstanc- es. Like the demand, the assurance is subject to the general requirement of good faith and fair dealing in the en- forcement of the contract (&#167; 205; see Comment d).</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Where the obligor&#8217;s insolvency gives the obligee reasonable grounds to believe that the obligor will commit a breach under the rule stated in &#167; 251, the obligee may suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed exchange until he receives assurance in the form of performance itself, an offer of performance, or adequate security.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A person is insolvent who either has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business or cannot pay his debts as they become due or is insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 253. Effect of a Repudiation as a Breach and on Other Party&#8217;s Duties</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an obligor repudiates a duty before he has committed a breach by non-performance and before he has received all of the agreed exchange for it, his repudiation alone gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises, one party&#8217;s repudiation of a duty to render performance dis- charges the other party&#8217;s remaining duties to render performance.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Breach.</i> An obligee under a contract is ordinarily entitled to the protection of his expectation that the obligor will perform. For this reason, a repudiation by the obligor under &#167; 250 or &#167; 251 generally gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach even though it is not accompanied or pre- ceded by a breach by non-performance. Such a repudiation is sometimes ellip- tically called an &#8220;anticipatory breach,&#8221; meaning a breach by anticipatory repu- diation, because it occurs before there is any breach by non-performance. If there is a breach by non-performance, in addition to the repudiation under &#167; 250 or &#167; 251 the breach is not one by repudiation alone and the rules stated in &#167; 243 rather than those stated in Subsection (1) apply. If, under &#167; 251, it was a breach by non-performance that gave the obligee grounds to believe that the obligor would commit a more seri- ous breach, the obligor&#8217;s failure to give assurances cannot give rise to a breach <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>by repudiation alone. The measure of damages in the case of a claim under this Section is governed by the rules stated in Topic 2 of Chapter 16.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. On April 1, A and B make a contract under which B is to work for A for three months beginning on June 1. On May 1, A repudiates by telling B he will not employ him. On May 15, B commences an ac- tion against A. B&#8217;s duty to work for A is discharged and he has a claim against A for damages for total breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. On July 1, A contracts to sell and B to buy a quantity of bar- rel staves, delivery and payment to be on December 1. On August 1, A repudiates by writing B that he will be unable to deliver staves at the contract price. On September 1, B commences an action against A. B&#8217;s duty to pay for the staves is dis- charged and he has a claim against A for damages for total breach. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;610.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Discharge.</i> Under Subsec- tion (1) a breach by repudiation alone can only give rise to a claim for total breach, although a breach by non- performance, even if coupled with a repudiation, can generally give rise to either a claim for partial breach or to one for total breach (&#167;&#167; 236, 237). Of course, in appropriate circumstances, the injured party can, after a breach by repudiation alone, pursue alterna- tive relief by seeking, for example, a decree of specific performance or an injunction. See Topic 3 of Chapter 16. Nevertheless, the rule stated in Sub- section (1) is one of those rules that are peculiar to breach by repudiation alone and differ from those applicable to a breach by non-performance. (Another such rule is that a breach by repudia- tion alone can be totally nullified by the party in breach (&#167; 257), while a breach by non-performance, whether coupled with a repudiation or not, cannot be.) Subsection (2) states a corollary of this rule that a breach by repudiation al- ways gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach: where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises, one party&#8217;s repudiation discharges any remaining duties of performance of the other party with re- spect to the expected exchange.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Scope.</i> If an obligor repudi- ates under &#167; 250 or &#167; 251 before he has received all of the agreed exchange for his promise, the repudiation alone gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach under Subsection (1). The most important example of such a case occurs when performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises and one party repudiates a duty with respect to the expected ex- change before the other party has fully performed that exchange. See Illustra- tions 1 and 2. (A repudiation of a duty whose performance is not part of the expected exchange, and for which there is therefore no agreed exchange, does not come within the rule stated in Sub- section (1). See, e.g., Illustration 3 to &#167; 232.) Another example occurs when one party repudiates a duty under an option contract before the other party has exercised the option by giving the agreed exchange. See Illustration 3. However, it is one of the established limits on the doctrine of &#8220;anticipatory breach&#8221; that an obligor&#8217;s repudiation alone, whether under &#167; 250 or &#167; 251, gives rise to no claim for damages at all if he has already received all of the agreed exchange for it. The rule stated in Subsection (1) does not, therefore, allow a claim for damages for total breach in such a case.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Avoiding harsh results of limitation.</i> The limitation described in Comment c sometimes avoids difficult problems of forecasting damages and is supported by the clear weight of au- thority. It has, however, been subjected to considerable criticism, and instances of its actual application are infrequent. Compare, for example, Illustration 3 with Illustration 4. A court can often avoid harsh results by making avail- able other types of relief, such as a de- claratory judgment or restitution. See &#167;&#167; 345, 373 and Comment a to &#167; 373. Insurance contracts are subject to spe- cial considerations which may make it appropriate to grant equitable relief in, for example, a suit for reinstatement. The degree to which the limitation might yield on a showing of manifest injustice, as where the refusal to pay is not in good faith, is unclear. Compare Comment d to &#167; 243. Furthermore, if the repudiation is coupled with a breach by non-performance that would otherwise give rise to a claim for dam- ages for only partial breach, it may give rise instead to a claim for damages for total breach, but whether it does so is governed by &#167; 243 and not by this Sec- tion.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Non-performance by injured party after repudiation.</i> If the parties are to exchange performances under an exchange of promises, each party&#8217;s duties to render performance are gen- erally regarded as conditional on the other party&#8217;s performance, or at least on his readiness to perform (&#167;&#167; 237, 238, 251, 253). This principle applies even though one party is already in breach by repudiation. His duty to pay damages is discharged if it subse- quently appears that there would have been a total failure of performance by the injured party. A failure is total in this context if it would have been suffi- cient to have discharged any remaining duties of the party in breach to render his performance. See &#167; 242. The result follows even if it appears that the fail- ure would have been justified and not a breach. Cf. &#167; 244.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Impracticability or frustra- tion after repudiation.</i> Under the rule stated in &#167; 253(1), a party&#8217;s breach by anticipatory repudiation immediately gives rise to a claim for damages for to- tal breach. If it subsequently appears that the duty that he repudiated would have been discharged by supervening impracticability (&#167; 261) or frustration (&#167; 265) before any breach by non-per- formance, his duty to pay damages is discharged. Impracticability or frus- tration that would have occurred after breach by non-performance may affect the measure of damages but does not discharge the duty to pay damages; cf. &#167;&#167; 344, 347, 352.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Effect of nullification.</i> A repu- diation may have three consequences: it may give rise to a claim for damages for total breach (&#167; 253(1)(1)), discharge duties (&#167; 253(2)(2)), and excuse the non-occurrence of a condition (&#167; 255). A party&#8217;s manifestation of doubt or ap- parent inability may entitle the other party to demand adequate assurance of due performance and to treat a fail- ure to give such assurance as a repu- diation under the rule stated in &#167; 251. If, however, the effect of the statement or other events constituting the repu- diation under &#167; 250 or the basis for the repudiation under &#167; 251 is nullified as provided in this Section, none of these consequences follows. Such a nullifica- tion does not, of course, alter the con- sequences of any breach by non-per- formance that may have taken place. If, for example, a repudiation accom- panies a breach by non-performance, nullification of the repudiation leaves the injured party a claim for damages for the breach, although the claim may no longer be one for damages for total breach (see Comment b to &#167; 243). If the repudiation is wholly anticipatory, nul- lification leaves the injured party with no claim at all. Compare the effect of events subsequent to a total breach by repudiation (&#167; 254). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Manner of retraction.</i> It is not necessary for the repudiator to use words in order to retract his statement. Conduct, such as an offer of perfor- mance, may be adequate to convey the idea of retraction to the injured party.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Time for nullification.</i> Once the injured party has materially changed his position in reliance on the repudiation, nullification would clearly be unjust. In the interest of certainty, however, it is undesirable to make the injured party&#8217;s rights turn exclusively on such a vague criterion, and he may therefore prevent subsequent nullifica- tion by indicating to the other party that he considers the repudiation fi- nal. It is, for example, enough under Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;612 that &#8220;the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indi- cated that he considers the repudiation final.&#8221; Cancellation of the contract or the commencement of an action claim- ing damages for total breach would be sufficient.

<p class="head2"><b>CHAPTER 11. IMPRACTICABILITY OF PERFORMANCE AND FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 261. Discharge by Supervening Impracticability</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where, after a contract is made, a party&#8217;s performance is made impracti- cable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Even though a party, in assuming a duty, has not qualified the language of his undertaking, a court may relieve him of that duty if performance has unexpectedly become impracticable as a result of a super- vening event (see Introductory Note to this Chapter). This Section states the general principle under which a party&#8217;s duty may be so discharged. The follow- ing three sections deal with the three categories of cases where this general principle has traditionally been ap- plied: supervening death or incapacity of a person necessary for performance (&#167; 262), supervening destruction of a specific thing necessary for perfor- mance (&#167; 263), and supervening pro- hibition or prevention by law (&#167; 264). But, like Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615(a), this Section states a prin- ciple broadly applicable to all types of impracticability and it &#8220;deliberately refrains from any effort at an exhaus- tive expression of contingencies&#8221; (Com- ment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615). The principle, like others in this Chapter, yields to a contrary agree- ment by which a party may assume a greater as well as a lesser obligation. By such an agreement, for example, a party may undertake to achieve a re- sult irrespective of supervening events that may render its achievement im- possible, and if he does so his non-per- formance is a breach even if it is caused by such an event. See Comment c. The rule stated in this Section applies only to discharge a duty to render a perfor- mance and does not affect a claim for breach that has already arisen. The ef- fect of events subsequent to a breach on the amount of damages recoverable is governed by the rules on remedies stated in Chapter 16. See Comment e to &#167; 347. Their effect on a claim for breach by anticipatory repudiation is governed by the rules on discharge stated in Chapter 12. Cases of existing, as opposed to supervening, impracti- cability are governed by &#167; 266 rather than this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Basic assumption.</i> In order for a supervening event to discharge a duty under this Section, the non-oc- currence of that event must have been a &#8220;basic assumption&#8221; on which both parties made the contract (see Intro- ductory Note to this Chapter). This is the criterion used by Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615(a). Its application is simple enough in the cases of the death of a person or destruction of a specific thing necessary for performance. The continued existence of the person or <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>thing (the non-occurrence of the death of destruction) is ordinarily a basic as- sumption on which the contract was made, so that death or destruction ef- fects a discharge. Its application is also simple enough in the cases of market shifts or the financial inability of one of the parties. The continuation of exist- ing market conditions and of the finan- cial situation of the parties are ordinar- ily not such assumptions, so that mere market shifts or financial inability do not usually effect discharge under the rule stated in this Section. In border- line cases this criterion is sufficiently flexible to take account of factors that bear on a just allocation of risk. The fact that the event was foreseeable, or even foreseen, does not necessarily compel a conclusion that its non-occur- rence was not a basic assumption. See Comment c to this Section and Com- ment a to &#167; 265.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. On June 1, A agrees to sell and B to buy goods to be delivered in October at a designated port. The port is subsequently closed by quar- antine regulations during the entire month of October, no commercially reasonable substitute performance is available (see Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 2&#8211;614(1)), and A fails to deliver the goods. A&#8217;s duty to deliver the goods is discharged, and A is not liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to produce a movie for B. As B knows, A&#8217;s only source of funds is a $100,000 de- posit in C bank. C bank fails, and A does not produce the movie. A&#8217;s duty to produce the movie is not discharged, and A is liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A and B make a contract under which B is to work for A for two years at a salary of $50,000 a year. At the end of one year, A dis- continues his business because gov- ernmental regulations have made it unprofitable and fires B. A&#8217;s duty to employ B is not discharged, and A is liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to sell and B to buy a specific machine owned by A to be delivered on July 30. On July 29, as a result of a creditor&#8217;s suit against A, a receiver is appointed and takes charge of all of A&#8217;s assets, and A does not deliver the goods on July 30. A&#8217;s duty to deliver the goods is not discharged, and A is li- able to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Contrary indication.</i> A party may, by appropriate language, agree to perform in spite of impracticability that would otherwise justify his non- performance under the rule stated in this Section. He can then be held liable for damages although he can- not perform. Even absent an express agreement, a court may decide, after considering all the circumstances, that a party impliedly assumed such a greater obligation. In this respect the rule stated in this Section paral- lels that of Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615, which applies &#8220;Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation. &#8230;&#8221; Circumstances relevant in deciding whether a party has as- sumed a greater obligation include his ability to have inserted a provision in the contract expressly shifting the risk of impracticability to the other party. This will depend on the extent to which the agreement was standardized (cf. &#167; 211), the degree to which the other party supplied the terms (cf. &#167; 206), and, in the case of a particular trade or other group, the frequency with which language so allocating the risk is used in that trade or group (cf. &#167; 219). The fact that a supplier has not taken ad- vantage of his opportunity expressly to shift the risk of a shortage in his supply by means of contract language may be regarded as more significant where he is middleman, with a vari- ety of sources of supply and an oppor- tunity to spread the risk among many <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>customers on many transactions by slight adjustment of his prices, than where he is a producer with a limited source of supply, few outlets, and no comparable opportunity. A commercial practice under which a party might be expected to insure or otherwise secure himself against a risk also militates against shifting it to the other party. If the supervening event was not reason- ably foreseeable when the contract was made, the party claiming discharge can hardly be expected to have provided against its occurrence. However, if it was reasonably foreseeable, or even foreseen, the opposite conclusion does not necessarily follow. Factors such as the practical difficulty of reaching agreement on the myriad of conceivable terms of a complex agreement may ex- cuse a failure to deal with improbable contingencies. See Comment b to this Section and Comment a to &#167; 265.</p>

The contract, prepared by A, con- tains no clause limiting A&#8217;s duty in the case of unfavorable weather, unforeseen circumstances, or other- wise. The boat then slips into deep water and fills with mud, making it impracticable for A to raise it. If the court concludes, on the basis of such circumstances as A&#8217;s experi- ence and the absence of any limita- tion in the contract that A prepared, that A assumed an absolute duty, it will decide that A&#8217;s duty to raise and float the boat is not discharged and that A is liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Impracticability.</i> Events that come within the rule stated in this Sec- tion are generally due either to &#8220;acts of God&#8221; or to acts of third parties. If the event that prevents the obligor&#8217;s performance is caused by the obligee, it will ordinarily amount to a breach by the latter and the situation will be governed by the rules stated in Chap- ter 10, without regard to this Section. See Illustrations 4&#8211;7 to &#167; 237. If the event is due to the fault of the obligor himself, this Section does not apply. As used here &#8220;fault&#8221; may include not only &#8220;willful&#8221; wrongs, but such other types of conduct as that amounting to breach of contract or to negligence. See Comment 1 to Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;613. Although the rule stated in this Section is sometimes phrased in terms of &#8220;im- possibility,&#8221; it has long been recognized that it may operate to discharge a party&#8217;s duty even though the event has not made performance absolutely im- possible. This Section, therefore, uses &#8220;impracticable,&#8221; the term employed by Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;615(a), to describe the required extent of the impediment to performance. Perfor- mance may be impracticable because extreme and unreasonable difficulty, expense, injury, or loss to one of the parties will be involved. A severe short- age of raw materials or of supplies due to war, embargo, local crop failure, un- foreseen shutdown of major sources of supply, or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or prevents performance altogether may bring the case within the rule stated in this Sec- tion. Performance may also be imprac- ticable because it will involve a risk of injury to person or to property, of one of the parties or of others, that is dispro- portionate to the ends to be attained by performance. However, &#8220;impracticabil- ity&#8221; means more than &#8220;impracticality.&#8221; A mere change in the degree of dif- ficulty or expense due to such causes as increased wages, prices of raw ma- terials, or costs of construction, unless well beyond the normal range, does not amount to impracticability since it is this sort of risk that a fixed-price contract is intended to cover. Further- more, a party is expected to use reason- able efforts to surmount obstacles to performance (see &#167; 205), and a performance <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>is impracticable only if it is so in spite of such efforts.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">7. A contracts with B to carry B&#8217;s goods on his ship to a designated foreign port. A civil war then unex- pectedly breaks out in that country and the rebels announce that they will try to sink all vessels bound for that port. A refuses to perform. Although A did not contract to sail on the vessel, the risk of injury to others is sufficient to make A&#8217;s per- formance impracticable. A&#8217;s duty to carry the goods to the designated port is discharged, and A is not li- able to B for breach of contract. Compare Illustration 5 to &#167; 262.</p>

A&#8217;s duty to car- ry the goods to the designated port is then discharged, and A is not li- able to B for breach of contract. If, however, B is a health organization and the goods are scarce medical supplies vital to the health of the population of the designated port, the court may conclude that the risk is not disproportionate to the ends to be attained and may reach a con- trary decision.</p>

The contract does not specify the route, but the voyage would normally be through the Straits of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, a distance of 10,000 miles.

A&#8217;s performance has not been made im- practicable. A&#8217;s duty to construct is not discharged, and A is liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. &#8220;Subjective&#8221; and &#8220;objective&#8221; impracticability.</i> It is sometimes said that the rule stated in this Section applies only when the performance <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>itself is made impracticable, without regard to the particular party who is to perform. The difference has been described as that between &#8220;the thing cannot be done&#8221; and &#8220;I cannot do it,&#8221; and the former has been characterized as &#8220;objective&#8221; and the latter as &#8220;subjec- tive.&#8221; This Section recognizes that if the performance remains practicable and it is merely beyond the party&#8217;s capacity to render it, he is ordinarily not discharged, but it does not use the terms &#8220;objective&#8221; and &#8220;subjective&#8221; to express this. Instead, the rationale is that a party generally assumes the risk of his own inability to perform his duty. Even if a party contracts to render a performance that depends on some act by a third party, he is not ordinarily discharged because of a failure by that party because this is also a risk that is commonly understood to be on the obli- gor.

A, a milkman, and B, a dairy farmer, make a contract under which B is to sell and A to buy all of A&#8217;s requirements of milk, but not less than 200 quarts a day, for one year. B may deliver milk from any source but expects to deliver milk from his own herd. B&#8217;s herd is de- stroyed because of hoof and mouth disease and he fails to deliver any milk. B&#8217;s duty to deliver milk is not discharged, and B is liable to A for breach of contract. See Illustration 1 to &#167; 263; compare Illustration 7 to &#167; 263.</p>

A contracts to sell and B to buy on credit 1,500,000 gallons of molasses &#8220;of the usual run from the C sugar refinery.&#8221; C delivers molas- ses to others but fails to deliver any to A, and A fails to deliver any to B. A&#8217;s duty to deliver molasses is not discharged, and A is liable to B for breach of contract. If A has a con- tract with C, C may be liable to A for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. A, a general contractor, is bidding on a construction contract with B which gives B the right to disapprove the choice of subcontrac- tors. A makes a contract with C, a subcontractor, under which, if B awards A the contract, A will obtain B&#8217;s approval of C and C will do the excavation for A. A is awarded the contract by B, but B disapproves A&#8217;s choice of C, and A has the excava- tion work done by another subcon- tractor. A&#8217;s duty to have C do the excavation is not discharged, and A is liable to C for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Alternative performances.</i> A contract may permit a party to choose to perform in one of several different ways, any of which will discharge his duty. Where the duty is to render such an alternative performance, the fact that one or more of the alternatives has become impracticable will not dis- charge the party&#8217;s duty to perform if at least one of them remains practicable. The form of the promise is not control- ling, however, and not every promise that is expressed in alternative form gives rise to a duty to render an al- ternative performance. For example, a surety&#8217;s undertaking that either the principal will perform or the surety will compensate the creditor does not ordinarily impose such a duty. See Re- statement of Security &#167; 117. Nor does a promise either to render a performance or pay liquidated damages impose such a duty. Furthermore, a duty that is originally one to render alternative performances ceases to be such a duty if all but one means of performance have been foreclosed, as by the lapse of time or the occurrence of a condition including election by the obligor, or on the grounds of public policy (Chapter 8) or unconscionability (&#167; 208).</p>

<p class="noindent">Where, after a contract is made, a party&#8217;s principal purpose is substan- tially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non- occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Rationale.</i> This Section deals with the problem that arises when a change in circumstances makes one party&#8217;s performance virtually worthless to the other, frustrating his purpose in making the contract. It is distinct from <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the problem of impracticability dealt with in the four preceding sections be- cause there is no impediment to perfor- mance by either party. Although there has been no true failure of performance in the sense required for the application of the rule stated in &#167; 237, the impact on the party adversely affected will be similar. The rule stated in this Section sets out the requirements for the dis- charge of that party&#8217;s duty. First, the purpose that is frustrated must have been a principal purpose of that party in making the contract. It is not enough that he had in mind some specific ob- ject without which he would not have made the contract. The object must be so completely the basis of the contract that, as both parties understand, with- out it the transaction would make little sense. Second, the frustration must be substantial. It is not enough that the transaction has become less profitable for the affected party or even that he will sustain a loss. The frustration must be so severe that it is not fairly to be regarded as within the risks that he assumed under the contract. Third, the non-occurrence of the frustrating event must have been a basic assumption on which the contract was made. This in- volves essentially the same sorts of de- terminations that are involved under the general rule on impracticability. See Comments b and c to &#167; 261. The foreseeability of the event is here, as it is there, a factor in that determination, but the mere fact that the event was foreseeable does not compel the conclu- sion that its non-occurrence was not such a basic assumption.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A and B make a contract under which B is to pay A $1,000 and is to have the use of A&#8217;s window on January 10 to view a parade that has been scheduled for that day. Because of the illness of an impor- tant official, the parade is cancelled. B refuses to use the window or pay the $1,000. B&#8217;s duty to pay $1,000 is discharged, and B is not liable to A for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts with B to print an advertisement in a souvenir program of an international yacht race, which has been scheduled by a yacht club, for a price of $10,000. The yacht club cancels the race be- cause of the outbreak of war. A has already printed the programs, but B refuses to pay the $10,000. B&#8217;s duty to pay $10,000 is discharged, and B is not liable to A for breach of con- tract. A may have a claim under the rule stated in &#167; 272(1).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A, who owns a hotel, and B, who owns a country club, make a contract under which A is to pay $1,000 a month and B is to make the club&#8217;s membership privileges available to the guests in A&#8217;s hotel free of charge to them. A&#8217;s build- ing is destroyed by fire without his fault, and A is unable to remain in the hotel business. A refuses to make further monthly payments. A&#8217;s duty to make monthly payments is discharged, and A is not liable to B for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A leases neon sign instal- lations to B for three years to ad- vertise and illuminate B&#8217;s place of business. After one year, a govern- ment regulation prohibits the light- ing of such signs. B refuses to make further payments of rent. B&#8217;s duty to pay rent is discharged, and B is not liable to A for breach of contract. See Illustration 7.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contracts to sell and B to buy a machine, to be delivered to B in the United States. B, as A knows, intends to export the machine to a particular country for resale. Be- fore delivery to B, a government regulation prohibits export of the machine to that country. B refuses to take or pay for the machine. If B can reasonably make other disposition <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the machine, even though at some loss, his principal purpose of putting the machine to commercial use is not substantially frustrated. B&#8217;s duty to take and pay for the ma- chine is not discharged, and B is li- able to A for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A leases a gasoline station to B. A change in traffic regulations so reduces B&#8217;s business that he is unable to operate the station except at a substantial loss. B refuses to make further payments of rent. If B can still operate the station, even though at such a loss, his princi- pal purpose of operating a gasoline station is not substantially frus- trated. B&#8217;s duty to pay rent is not discharged, and B is liable to A for breach of contract. The result would be the same if substantial loss were caused instead by a government regulation rationing gasoline or a termination of the franchise under which B obtained gasoline.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Limitations on scope.</i> The rule stated in this Section is subject to limi- tations similar to those stated in &#167; 261 with respect to impracticability. It ap- plies only when the frustration is with- out the fault of the party who seeks to take advantage of the rule, and it does not apply if the language or circum- stances indicate the contrary. Frustra- tion by circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract rath- er than by supervening circumstances is governed by the similar rule stated in &#167; 266(2).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as in Illustration 4, the government regulation provides for a procedure under which B can apply for an exemption, but B, in breach of his duty of good faith and fair dealing (&#167; 205), fails to make such an appli- cation. Unless it is found that such an application would have been un- successful, B&#8217;s duty to pay rent is not discharged, and B is liable to A for breach of contract. Cf. Illustra- tion 11 to &#167; 261; Illustration 3 to &#167; 264.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 266. Existing Impracticability or Frustration</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where, at the time a contract is made, a party&#8217;s performance un- der it is impracticable without his fault because of a fact of which he has no reason to know and the non-existence of which is a basic assumption on which the contract is made, no duty to render that performance arises, unless the language or circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where, at the time a contract is made, a party&#8217;s principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by a fact of which he has no reason to know and the non-existence of which is a basic assumption on which the contract is made, no duty of that party to render performance arises, unless the language or circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A party&#8217;s failure to render or to offer performance may, except as stated in Subsection (2), affect the other party&#8217;s duties under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 237 and 238 even though the failure is justified under the rules stated in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) does not apply if the other party assumed the risk that he would have to perform despite such a failure.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 268. Effect on Other Party&#8217;s Duties of a Prospective Failure Justified by Impracticability or Frustration</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party&#8217;s prospective failure of performance may, except as stated in Subsection (2), discharge the other party&#8217;s duties or allow him to sus- pend performance under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 251(1) and 253(2) even though the failure would be justified under the rules stated in this Chap- ter.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) does not apply if the other party assumed the risk that he would have to perform in spite of such a failure.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 269. Temporary Impracticability or Frustration</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Impracticability of performance or frustration of purpose that is only tem- porary suspends the obligor&#8217;s duty to perform while the impracticability or frustration exists but does not discharge his duty or prevent it from arising unless his performance after the cessation of the impracticability or frustration would be materially more burdensome than had there been no impracticability or frustration.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 270. Partial Impracticability</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where only part of an obligor&#8217;s performance is impracticable, his duty to render the remaining part is unaffected if</p>

<p class="noindent">Except as stated in &#167;&#167; 274&#8211;77, an obligee&#8217;s manifestation of assent to a discharge is not effective unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) it is made for consideration,</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) it is made in circumstances in which a promise would be en- forceable without consideration, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) it has induced such action or forbearance as would make a promise enforceable.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 274. Cancellation, Destruction or Surrender of a Writing</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An obligee&#8217;s cancellation, destruction or surrender to the obligor of a writ- ing of a type customarily accepted as a symbol or as evidence of his right discharges without consideration the obligor&#8217;s duty if it is done with the manifested intention to discharge it.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 275. Assent to Discharge Duty of Return Performance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If a party, before he has fully performed his duty under a contract, mani- fests to the other party his assent to discharge the other party&#8217;s duty to render part or all of the agreed exchange, the duty is to that extent dis- charged without consideration.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 276. Assent to Discharge Duty to Transfer Property</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A duty of an obligor in possession of identified personal property to trans- fer an interest in that property is discharged without consideration if the obligee manifests to the obligor his assent to the discharge of that duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 277. Renunciation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A written renunciation signed and delivered by the obligee dis- charges without consideration a duty arising out of a breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A renunciation by the obligee on his acceptance from the obligor of some performance under a contract discharges without consideration a duty to pay damages for a breach that gives rise only to a claim for dam- ages for partial breach of contract.</p>
<p class="head3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>TOPIC 2. SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE, SUBSTITUTED CONTRACT, ACCORD AND ACCOUNT STATED</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 278. Substituted Performance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If an obligee accepts in satisfaction of the obligor&#8217;s duty a per- formance offered by the obligor that differs from what is due, the duty is discharged.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If an obligee accepts in satisfaction of the obligor&#8217;s duty a perfor- mance offered by a third person, the duty is discharged, but an obligor who has not previously assented to the performance for his benefit may in a reasonable time after learning of it render the discharge inoperative from the beginning by disclaimer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 279. Substituted Contract</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A substituted contract is a contract that is itself accepted by the obligee in satisfaction of the obligor&#8217;s existing duty.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The substituted contract discharges the original duty and breach of the substituted contract by the obligor does not give the obligee a right to enforce the original duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 280. Novation</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A novation is a substituted contract that includes as a party one who was neither the obligor nor the obligee of the original duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 281. Accord and Satisfaction</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An accord is a contract under which an obligee promises to accept a stated performance in satisfaction of the obligor&#8217;s existing duty. Perfor- mance of the accord discharges the original duty.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Until performance of the accord, the original duty is suspended unless there is such a breach of the accord by the obligor as discharges the new duty of the obligee to accept the performance in satisfaction. If there is such a breach, the obligee may enforce either the original duty or any duty under the accord.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Breach of the accord by the obligee does not discharge the original duty, but the obligor may maintain a suit for specific performance of the accord, in addition to any claim for damages for partial breach.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 282. Account Stated</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An account stated is a manifestation of assent by debtor and cred- itor to a stated sum as an accurate computation of an amount due the creditor. A party&#8217;s retention without objection for an unreasonably long time of a statement of account rendered by the other party is a manifesta- tion of assent.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) The account stated does not itself discharge any duty but is an admission by each party of the facts asserted and a promise by the debtor to pay according to its terms.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 3. AGREEMENT OF RESCISSION, RELEASE AND CONTRACT NOT TO SUE</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 283. Agreement of Rescission</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An agreement of rescission is an agreement under which each party agrees to discharge all of the other party&#8217;s remaining duties of per- formance under an existing contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An agreement of rescission discharges all remaining duties of performance of both parties. It is a question of interpretation whether the parties also agree to make restitution with respect to performance that has been rendered.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 284. Release</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A release is a writing providing that a duty owed to the maker of the release is discharged immediately or on the occurrence of a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The release takes effect on delivery as stated in &#167;&#167; 101&#8211;03 and, subject to the occurrence of any condition, discharges the duty.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 285. Contract Not to Sue</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract not to sue is a contract under which the obligee of a duty promises never to sue the obligor or a third person to enforce the duty or not to do so for a limited time.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as stated in Subsection (3), a contract never to sue dis- charges the duty and a contract not to sue for a limited time bars an ac- tion to enforce the duty during that time.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A contract not to sue one co-obligor bars levy of execution on the property of the promisee during the agreed time but does not bar an ac- tion or the recovery of judgment against any co-obligor.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 4. ALTERATION</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 286. Alteration of Writing</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If one to whom a duty is owed under a contract alters a writing that is an integrated agreement or that satisfies the Statute of Frauds with respect to that contract, the duty is discharged if the alteration is fraudulent and material.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An alteration is material if it would, if effective, vary any party&#8217;s legal relations with the maker of the alteration or adversely affect that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>party&#8217;s legal relations with a third person. The unauthorized insertion in a blank space in a writing is an alteration.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 287. Assent to or Forgiveness of Alteration</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If a party, knowing of an alteration that discharges his duty, manifests assent to the altered terms, his manifestation is equivalent to an acceptance of an offer to substitute those terms.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a party, knowing of an alteration that discharges his duty, as- serts a right under the original contract or otherwise manifests a willing- ness to remain subject to the original contract or to forgive the alteration, the original contract is revived.</p>

<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. JOINT AND SEVERAL PROMISORS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 288. Promises of the Same Performance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where two or more parties to a contract make a promise or prom- ises to the same promisee, the manifested intention of the parties de- termines whether they promise that the same performance or separate performances shall be given.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless a contrary intention is manifested, a promise by two or more promisors is a promise that the same performance shall be given.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 289. Joint, Several, and Joint and Several Promisors of the Same Performance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where two or more parties to a contract promise the same per- formance to the same promisee, each is bound for the whole performance thereof, whether his duty is joint, several, or joint and several.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where two or more parties to a contract promise the same perfor- mance to the same promisee, they incur only a joint duty unless an inten- tion is manifested to create several duties or joint and several duties.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) By statute in most states some or all promises which would oth- erwise create only joint duties create joint and several duties.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 290. Compulsory Joinder of Joint Promisors</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) By statute in most states where the distinction between joint du- ties and joint and several duties retains significance, an action can be maintained against one or more promisors who incur only a joint duty, even though other promisors subject to the same duty are not served with process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) In the absence of statute, an action can be maintained against promisors who incur only a joint duty without joinder of those beyond the jurisdiction of the court, the representatives of deceased promisors, or those against whom the duty is not enforceable at the time of suit.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 291. Judgment in an Action Against Co-Promisors</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In an action against promisors of the same performance, whether their duties are joint, several, or joint and several, judgment can properly be entered for or against one even though no judgment or a different judg- ment is entered with respect to another, except that judgment for one and against another is improper where there has been a determination on the merits and the liability of one cannot exist without the liability of the other.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 292. Effect of Judgment for or Against Co-Promisors</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A judgment against one or more promisors does not discharge oth- er promisors of the same performance unless joinder of the other promi- sors is required by the rule stated in &#167; 290. By statute in most states judg- ment against one promisor does not discharge co-promisors even where such joinder is required.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The effect of judgment for one or more promisors of the same per- formance is determined by the rules of res judicata relating to suretyship or vicarious liability.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 293. Effect of Performance or Satisfaction on Co-Promisors</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Full or partial performance or other satisfaction of the contractual duty of a promisor discharges the duty to the obligee of each other promisor of the same performance to the extent of the amount or value applied to the discharge of the duty of the promisor who renders it.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a ben- eficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and either</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary; or</p>

<p class="indent">(2) An incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Promisee and beneficiary.</i> This Section distinguishes an &#8220;intended&#8221; beneficiary, who acquires a right by virtue of a promise, from an &#8220;inciden- tal&#8221; beneficiary, who does not. See &#167;&#167; 304, 315. Section 2 defines &#8220;prom- isee&#8221; as the person to whom a prom- ise is addressed, and &#8220;beneficiary&#8221; as a person other than the promisee who <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>will be benefitted by performance of the promise. Both terms are neutral with respect to rights and duties: either or both or neither may have a legal right to performance. Either promisee or beneficiary may but need not be con- nected with the transaction in other ways: neither promisee nor beneficiary is necessarily the person to whom per- formance is to be rendered, the person who will receive economic benefit, or the person who furnished the consider- ation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Promise to pay the promisee&#8217;s debt.</i> The type of beneficiary covered by Subsection (1)(a) is often referred to as a &#8220;creditor beneficiary.&#8221; In such cases the promisee is surety for the promisor, the promise is an asset of the promisee, and a direct action by ben- eficiary against promisor is normally appropriate to carry out the intention of promisor and promisee, even though no intention is manifested to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance. Promise of a performance other than the payment of money may be governed by the same principle if the promisee&#8217;s obligation is regarded as easily convertible into money, as in cas- es of obligations to deliver commodities or securities which are actively traded in organized markets. Less liquid obli- gations are left to Subsection (1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A suretyship relation may exist even though the duty of the promisee is voidable or is unenforceable by reason of the statute of limitations, the Statute of Frauds, or a discharge in bankrupt- cy, and Subsection (1)(a) covers such cases. The term &#8220;creditor beneficiary&#8221; has also sometimes been used with reference to promises to satisfy a sup- posed or asserted duty of the promisee, but there is no suretyship if the prom- isee has never been under any duty to the beneficiary. Hence such cases are not covered by Subsection (1)(a). The beneficiary of a promise to discharge a lien on the promisee&#8217;s property, or of a promise to satisfy a duty of a third person, is similarly excluded from Sub- section (1)(a). Such beneficiaries may, however, be &#8220;intended beneficiaries&#8221; under Subsection (1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A owes C a debt of $100. The debt is barred by the statute of limitations or by a discharge in bankruptcy, or is unenforceable be- cause of the Statute of Frauds. B promises A to pay the barred or un- enforceable debt. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. B promises A to furnish support for A&#8217;s minor child C, whom A is bound by law to support. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsec- tion (1)(a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. B promises A to pay what- ever debts A may incur in a certain undertaking. A incurs in the under- taking debts to C, D and E. If the promise is interpreted as a promise that B will pay C, D and E, they are intended beneficiaries under Sub- section (1)(a); if the money is to be paid to A in order that he may be provided with money to pay C, D and E, they are at most incidental beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Gift promise.</i> Where the prom- ised performance is not paid for by the recipient, discharges no right that he has against anyone, and is apparently designed to benefit him, the promise is often referred to as a &#8220;gift promise.&#8221; The beneficiary of such a promise is of- ten referred to as a &#8220;donee beneficiary&#8221;; he is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(b). The contract need not provide that performance is to be rendered directly to the beneficiary: a gift may be made to the beneficiary, for example, by payment of his debt. Nor is any contact or communication with the beneficiary essential.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, an insurance company, promises B in a policy of insurance to pay $10,000 on B&#8217;s death to C, B&#8217;s wife. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. C is a troublesome person who is annoying A. A dislikes him but, believing the best way to obtain freedom from annoyance is to make a present, secures from B a prom- ise to give C a box of cigars. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsec- tion (1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A&#8217;s son C is indebted to D. With the purpose of assisting C, A secures from B a promise to pay the debt to D. Both C and D are intend- ed beneficiaries under Subsection (1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A owes C $100 for money lent. B promises A to pay C $200, both as a discharge of the debt and as an indication of A&#8217;s gratitude to C for making the loan. C is an in- tended beneficiary under Subsec- tion (1)(a) as to the amount of the debt and under Subsection (1)(b) as to the excess.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A conveys land to B in consideration of B&#8217;s promise to pay $15,000 as follows: $5,000 to C, A&#8217;s wife, on whom A wishes to make a settlement, $5,000 to D to whom A is indebted in that amount, and $5,000 to E, a life insurance compa- ny, to purchase an annuity payable to A during his life. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(b); D is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(a); E is an incidental beneficiary.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A owes C $100. Not know- ing of any such debt, B promises A to pay $100 to C. C is an intended beneficiary under Subsection (1)(a) if A manifests an intention that the payment is to satisfy the debt, an intended beneficiary under Subsec- tion (1)(b) if A manifests an inten- tion to make a gift of $100, leaving outstanding the original debt.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Other intended beneficiaries.</i> Either a promise to pay the promisee&#8217;s debt to a beneficiary or a gift promise involves a manifestation of intention by the promisee and promisor suffi- cient, in a contractual setting, to make reliance by the beneficiary both reason- able and probable. Other cases may be quite similar in this respect. Examples are a promise to perform a supposed or asserted duty of the promisee, a prom- ise to discharge a lien on the promisee&#8217;s property, or a promise to satisfy the duty of a third person. In such cases, if the beneficiary would be reasonable in relying on the promise as manifesting an intention to confer a right on him, he is an intended beneficiary. Where there is doubt whether such reliance would be reasonable, considerations of procedural convenience and other factors not strictly dependent on the manifested intention of the parties may affect the question whether under Subsection (1) recognition of a right in the beneficiary is appropriate. In some cases an overriding policy, which may be embodied in a statute, requires rec- ognition of such a right without regard to the intention of the parties.</p>

C, a downstream landowner, is an intended beneficiary under Subsec- tion (1)(b).</p>

Later A sells a car to C, telling C about the insurance. C is an intended benefi- ciary.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. B contracts to build a house for A. Pursuant to the con- tract, B and his surety S execute a payment bond to A by which they promise A that all of B&#8217;s debts for labor and materials on the house will be paid. B later employs C as a carpenter and buys lumber from D. C and D are intended beneficiaries of S&#8217;s promise to A, whether or not they have power to create liens on the house.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. C asserts that A owes him $100. A does not owe this money, or think that he owes it, but rath- er than engage in litigation and in order to obtain peace of mind A secures a promise from B to pay C $100. C is an intended beneficiary.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Incidental beneficiaries.</i> Per- formance of a contract will often ben- efit a third person. But unless the third person is an intended beneficiary as here defined, no duty to him is created. See &#167; 315.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">19. A contracts to erect a build- ing for C. B then contracts with A to supply lumber needed for the build- ing. C is an incidental beneficiary of B&#8217;s promise, and B is an incidental beneficiary of C&#8217;s promise to pay A for the building.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Trust and agency.</i> Where mon- ey or property is transferred from one person to another with an intention to benefit a third person, the manifested intention of the parties determines whether the transferee is an agent for the transferor or the third person or a trustee for the third person or whether the third person is the beneficiary of a promise made by the transferee. See Restatement, Second, Agency &#167;&#167; 14B, 14L; Restatement, Second, Trusts &#167;&#167; 8, 14. Similarly, an agreement between two parties may constitute one the agent of the other to confer a benefit on a third person, or the promise of one may be made to the other as trustee for a third person, or a third person may be the beneficiary of a promise of either or both; the manifested inten- tion of the parties determines which of these possible relations is created for the particular purpose involved. There <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>is a fiduciary relation between agent and principal or between trustee and beneficiary, but not between promisor or promisee and beneficiary of a con- tract. Agency requires the consent of the principal and the agent; a trust or a contract for the benefit of a third per- son does not require the consent of the beneficiary. Either the promisee or the beneficiary of a promise may be made a trustee of rights arising by virtue of the promise; although the beneficiary of such a trust is a beneficiary of the promise under this Section, his rights must be enforced in accordance with the law of Trusts. See Restatement, Second, Trusts &#167;&#167; 26, 177, 199.</p>

<p class="noindent">A beneficiary who has not previously assented to the promise for his ben- efit may in a reasonable time after learning of its existence and terms render any duty to himself inoperative from the beginning by disclaimer.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 307. Remedy of Specific Performance</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where specific performance is otherwise an appropriate remedy, either the promisee or the beneficiary may maintain a suit for specific enforce- ment of a duty owed to an intended beneficiary.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Suit by beneficiary.</i> Whether specific performance is an appropri- ate remedy is determined by the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 357&#8211;69. Where a contract creates a duty to a beneficiary under the rule stated in &#167; 304, the beneficiary is a proper party plaintiff either in an action for damages or in a suit for spe- cific performance. He is the real party in interest within the meaning of any <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>statute requiring suit to be brought by such a party. There is no general re- quirement that the promisee be made a party, but the promisee is ordinarily a proper party and the circumstances may be such that a final decree should await joinder of the promisee. As to grant of an injunction instead of spe- cific performance, see &#167; 357(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Suit by promisee.</i> Even though a contract creates a duty to a beneficia- ry, the promisee has a right to perfor- mance. See &#167; 305. The promisee cannot recover damages suffered by the benefi- ciary, but the promisee is a proper par- ty to sue for specific performance if that remedy is otherwise appropriate under the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 357&#8211;69. Where a statute requires suit to be prosecuted in the name of the real party in inter- est, the promisee is commonly permit- ted to sue either as the &#8220;trustee of an express trust&#8221; or by an express provi- sion for &#8220;a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another.&#8221; See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 17. There is no general requirement that the benefi- ciary be joined in such a suit; whether he should or must be made a party de- pends on the circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Promise to pay the promisee&#8217;s debt.</i> Where the promised performance will satisfy an obligation of the prom- isee to pay money to the beneficiary, the promisee may suffer substantial damages as a result of breach. He is entitled to recover such damages so long as there is no conflict with rights of the beneficiary or the promisor. But the promisee as surety for the promisor is not permitted to compete with the beneficiary for the assets of the promi- sor, and the promisor is ordinarily en- titled to protection against enforced double liability. See &#167;&#167; 305, 310. These difficulties can be avoided by specific performance of the surety&#8217;s right to ex- oneration. See Restatement of Security &#167; 112.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a stockholder of X, a corporation, guarantees payment of a debt owed by X to C. A sells his stock to B, who agrees to assume and pay A&#8217;s obligation on the guar- anty. B fails to pay, and C sues A on the guaranty. A may obtain a de- cree directing B to pay the debt to C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Gift promise.</i> Where the prom- isee intends to make a gift of the prom- ised performance to the beneficiary, the beneficiary ordinarily has an economic interest in the performance but the promisee does not. Thus the promisee may suffer no damages as the result of breach by the promisor. In such cases the promisee&#8217;s remedy in damages is not an adequate remedy within the rules stated in &#167;&#167; 359 and 360, and spe- cific performance may be appropriate. See Illustration 1 to &#167; 305. The court may of course so fashion its decree as to protect the interests of the promisee and beneficiary without unnecessary injury to the promisor or innocent third persons. See &#167; 358.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 308. Identification of Beneficiaries</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not essential to the creation of a right in an intended beneficiary that he be identified when a contract containing the promise is made.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 309. Defenses Against the Beneficiary</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A promise creates no duty to a beneficiary unless a contract is formed between the promisor and the promisee; and if a contract is void- able or unenforceable at the time of its formation the right of any benefi- ciary is subject to the infirmity.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a contract ceases to be binding in whole or in part because of impracticability, public policy, non-occurrence of a condition, or present or prospective failure of performance, the right of any beneficiary is to that extent discharged or modified.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Except as stated in Subsections (1) and (2) and in &#167; 311 or as pro- vided by the contract, the right of any beneficiary against the promisor is not subject to the promisor&#8217;s claims or defenses against the promisee or to the promisee&#8217;s claims or defenses against the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A beneficiary&#8217;s right against the promisor is subject to any claim or defense arising from his own conduct or agreement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 310. Remedies of the Beneficiary of a Promise to Pay the Promisee&#8217;s Debt; Reimbursement of Promisee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an intended beneficiary has an enforceable claim against the promisee, he can obtain a judgment or judgments against either the promisee or the promisor or both based on their respective duties to him. Satisfaction in whole or in part of either of these duties, or of a judgment thereon, satisfies to that extent the other duty or judgment, subject to the promisee&#8217;s right of subrogation.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) To the extent that the claim of an intended beneficiary is satis- fied from assets of the promisee, the promisee has a right of reimburse- ment from the promisor, which may be enforced directly and also, if the beneficiary&#8217;s claim is fully satisfied, by subrogation to the claim of the beneficiary against the promisor, and to any judgment thereon and to any security therefor.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 311. Variation of a Duty to a Beneficiary</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Discharge or modification of a duty to an intended beneficiary by conduct of the promisee or by a subsequent agreement between promisor and promisee is ineffective if a term of the promise creating the duty so provides.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In the absence of such a term, the promisor and promisee retain power to discharge or modify the duty by subsequent agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Such a power terminates when the beneficiary, before he receives notification of the discharge or modification, materially changes his posi- tion in justifiable reliance on the promise or brings suit on it or manifests assent to it at the request of the promisor or promisee.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(4) If the promisee receives consideration for an attempted discharge or modification of the promisor&#8217;s duty which is ineffective against the ben- eficiary, the beneficiary can assert a right to the consideration so received. The promisor&#8217;s duty is discharged to the extent of the amount received by the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 312. Mistake as to Duty to Beneficiary</b></p>

<p class="indent">(1) The rules stated in this Chapter apply to contracts with a govern- ment or governmental agency except to the extent that application would contravene the policy of the law authorizing the contract or prescribing remedies for its breach.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In particular, a promisor who contracts with a government or gov- ernmental agency to do an act for or render a service to the public is not subject to contractual liability to a member of the public for consequential damages resulting from performance or failure to perform unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the terms of the promise provide for such liability; or</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) The statements in this Chapter are qualified in some respects by statutory and other rules governing negotiable instruments and docu- ments, relating to interests in land, and affecting other classes of con- tracts.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. WHAT CAN BE ASSIGNED OR DELEGATED</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 317. Assignment of a Right</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An assignment of a right is a manifestation of the assignor&#8217;s in- tention to transfer it by virtue of which the assignor&#8217;s right to perfor- mance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contractual right can be assigned unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the substitution of a right of the assignee for the right of the assignor would materially change the duty of the obligor, or materially increase the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or materi- ally impair his chance of obtaining return performance, or materially reduce its value to him, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the assignment is forbidden by statute or is otherwise inopera- tive on grounds of public policy, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) assignment is validly precluded by contract.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 318. Delegation of Performance of Duty</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An obligor can properly delegate the performance of his duty to another unless the delegation is contrary to public policy or the terms of his promise.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless otherwise agreed, a promise requires performance by a particular person only to the extent that the obligee has a substantial interest in having that person perform or control the acts promised.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Unless the obligee agrees otherwise, neither delegation of per- formance nor a contract to assume the duty made with the obligor by the person delegated discharges any duty or liability of the delegating obligor.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 319. Delegation of Performance of Condition</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where a performance by a person is made a condition of a duty, performance by a person delegated by his satisfies that requirement un- less the delegation is contrary to public policy or the terms of the agree- ment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless otherwise agreed, an agreement requires performance of a condition by a particular person only to the extent that the obligor has <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a substantial interest in having that person perform or control the acts required.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 320. Assignment of Conditional Rights</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a right is created by an option contract or is conditional on the performance of a return promise or is otherwise conditional does not prevent its assignment before the condition occurs.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 321. Assignment of Future Rights</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute, an assignment of a right to payment expected to arise out of an existing employment or other con- tinuing business relationship is effective in the same way as an assign- ment of an existing right.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as otherwise provided by statute and as stated in Subsec- tion (1), a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a con- tract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 322. Contractual Prohibition of Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a contract term prohibiting assignment of &#8220;the contract&#8221; bars only the delegation to an assignee of the performance by the assignor of a duty or condition.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contract term prohibiting assignment of rights under the con- tract, unless a different intention is manifested,</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) does not forbid assignment of a right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor&#8217;s due perfor- mance of his entire obligation;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) gives the obligor a right to damages for breach of the terms forbidding assignment but does not render the assignment ineffective;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) is for the benefit of the obligor, and does not prevent the as- signee from acquiring rights against the assignor or the obligor from discharging his duty as if there were no such prohibition.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 323. Obligor&#8217;s Assent to Assignment or Delegation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A term of a contract manifesting an obligor&#8217;s assent to the future assignment of a right or an obligee&#8217;s assent to the future delegation of the performance of a duty or condition is effective despite any subsequent objection.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A manifestation of such assent after the formation of a contract is similarly effective if made for consideration or in circumstances in which a promise would be binding without consideration, or if a material change of position takes place in reliance on the manifestation.</p>
<p class="head3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>TOPIC 2. MODE OF ASSIGNMENT OR DELEGATION</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 324. Mode of Assignment in General</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is essential to an assignment of a right that the obligee manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person without further action or manifestation of intention by the obligee. The manifestation may be made to the other or to a third person on his behalf and, except as pro- vided by statute or by contract, may be made either orally or by a writing.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 325. Order as Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A written order drawn upon an obligor and signed and delivered to another person by the obligee is an assignment if it is conditional on the existence of a duty of the drawee to the drawer to comply with the order and the drawer manifests an intention that a person other than the drawer is to retain the performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An order which directs the drawee to render a performance with- out reference to any duty of the drawee is not of itself an assignment, even though the drawee is under a duty to the drawer to comply with the order and even though the order indicates a particular account to be deb- ited or any other fund or source from which reimbursement is expected.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 326. Partial Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), an assignment of a part of a right, whether the part is specified as a fraction, as an amount, or oth- erwise, is operative as to that part to the same extent and in the same manner as if the part had been a separate right.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the obligor has not contracted to perform separately the as- signed part of a right, no legal proceeding can be maintained by the as- signor or assignee against the obligor over his objection, unless all the persons entitled to the promised performance are joined in the proceed- ing, or unless joinder is not feasible and it is equitable to proceed without joinder.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 327. Acceptance or Disclaimer by the Assignee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A manifestation of assent by an assignee to the assignment is es- sential to make it effective unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) a third person gives consideration for the assignment, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the assignment is irrevocable by virtue of the delivery of a writing to a third person.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An assignee who has not manifested assent to an assignment may, within a reasonable time after learning of its existence and terms, render it inoperative from the beginning by disclaimer.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 328. Interpretation of Words of Assignment; Effect of Acceptance of Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary, as in an assignment for security, an assignment of &#8220;the contract&#8221; or of &#8220;all my rights under the contract&#8221; or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of the assignor&#8217;s rights and a delegation of his unper- formed duties under the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary, the acceptance by an assignee of such an assignment operates as a prom- ise to the assignor to perform the assignor&#8217;s unperformed duties, and the obligor of the assigned rights is an intended beneficiary of the promise.</p>
<p class="noindent">Caveat: The Institute expresses no opinion as to whether the rule stated in Subsection (2) applies to an assignment by a purchaser of his rights under a contract for the sale of land.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 329. Repudiation by Assignor and Novation With Assignee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The legal effect of a repudiation by an assignor of his duty to the obligor of the assigned right is not limited by the fact that the assignee is a competent person and has promised to perform the duty.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the obligor, with knowledge of such a repudiation, accepts any performance from the assignee without reserving his rights against the assignor, a novation arises by which the duty of the assignor is discharged and a similar duty of the assignee is substituted.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Repudiation and its effects.</i> In some cases a repudiation by one party to a contract discharges the duty of the other party; in some cases it requires the other to treat as total a breach which might otherwise be par- tial, or it may itself be a total breach. See &#167; 253; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;610. For these purposes repudia- tion includes a positive statement by an assignor that he will not or cannot substantially perform his duties, or any voluntary affirmative action which renders substantial performance ap- parently impossible. In some circum- stances a statement that he doubts whether he will substantially perform, or that he takes no responsibility for performance, or even a failure to give adequate assurance of performance may have a similar effect. See &#167;&#167; 250&#8211;51.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Scope of obligor&#8217;s assent.</i> The assignment of a contractual right and delegation to the assignee of the assign- or&#8217;s duty is often a matter of course. The obligor of the assigned right may then have a right to withhold performance until he receives adequate assurance of performance by the assignee. Section 251. Failure to demand such assurance and acceptance of performance by the assignee manifest the obligor&#8217;s assent to the assignment and delegation (see &#167; 323), but not to the discharge of the assignor&#8217;s duty. However, when the obligor knows that the delegating as- signor has repudiated his duty he has reason to know that the performance of the assignee is offered by way of nova- tion, and his silent acceptance of the performance operates as acceptance of the offer of novation. Compare &#167; 69.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A is under a contract with B to build a house for $10,000. A as- signs his rights under the contract to C, who agrees to assume A&#8217;s duty to build the house. B is informed of the assignment and assumption, and makes no objection as C partly performs. A remains bound to B as surety for C&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. In Illustration 1, A with- draws from the construction busi- ness and informs B that he takes no further responsibility for C&#8217;s performance. B makes no objection and C proceeds with the work. A is discharged.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Reservation of rights.</i> The ob- ligor of an assigned right cannot be forced to assent to a repudiation by the assignor or to an offer of a substituted contract with the assignee. To avoid the implication that his silence gives assent, he must manifest either to the assignor or to the assignee his inten- tion to retain unimpaired his rights against the assignor, but no particular form is required. See Uniform Com- mercial Code &#167;&#167; 1&#8211;207, 3&#8211;606; &#167; 281. If the terms of the assignment so provide, the delegation or assumption of duty may be defeated in such a case, and the repudiation may be retracted before it has been acted on. See Uniform Com- mercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;611. Where the as- signee continues performance, the res- ervation of rights by the obligor means that the assignor, if compelled to pay for the assignee&#8217;s default, will have a right over against the assignee.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. In Illustration 2, on being informed of A&#8217;s repudiation, B noti- fies A or C that further performance is &#8220;without prejudice.&#8221; A is not dis- charged.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 330. Contracts to Assign in the Future, or to Transfer Proceeds to Be Received</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract to make a future assignment of a right, or to transfer proceeds to be received in the future by the promisor, is not an assign- ment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as provided by statute, the effect of such a contract on the rights and duties of the obligor and third persons is determined by the rules relating to specific performance of contracts.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 3. EFFECT BETWEEN ASSIGNOR AND ASSIGNEE</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 331. Partially Effective Assignments</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An assignment may be conditional, revocable, or voidable by the assignor, or unenforceable by virtue of a Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 332. Revocability Of Gratuitous Assignments</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Unless a contrary intention is manifested, a gratuitous assign- ment is irrevocable if</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the assignment is in a writing either signed or under seal that is delivered by the assignor; or</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) the assignment is accompanied by delivery of a writing of a type customarily accepted as a symbol or as evidence of the right as- signed.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as stated in this Section, a gratuitous assignment is revo- cable and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor&#8217;s death or incapacity, by a subsequent assignment by the assignor, or by notifica- tion from the assignor received by the assignee or by the obligor.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A gratuitous assignment ceases to be revocable to the extent that before the assignee&#8217;s right is terminated he obtains</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) payment or satisfaction of the obligation, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) judgment against the obligor, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) a new contract of the obligor by novation.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A gratuitous assignment is irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice where the assignor should reasonably expect the assign- ment to induce action or forbearance by the assignee or a subassignee and the assignment does induce such action or forbearance.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) An assignment is gratuitous unless it is given or taken</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) in exchange for a performance or return promise that would be consideration for a promise; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-exist- ing debt or other obligation.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 333. Warranties of an Assignor</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Unless a contrary intention is manifested, one who assigns or purports to assign a right by assignment under seal or for value warrants to the assignee</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) that he will do nothing to defeat or impair the value of the as- signment and has no knowledge of any fact which would do so;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) that the right, as assigned, actually exists and is subject to no limitations or defenses good against the assignor other than those stated or apparent at the time of the assignment;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) that any writing evidencing the right which is delivered to the assignee or exhibited to him to induce him to accept the assignment is genuine and what it purports to be.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An assignment does not of itself operate as a warranty that the obligor is solvent or that he will perform his obligation.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) An assignor is bound by affirmations and promises to the assign- ee with reference to the right assigned in the same way and to the same extent that one who transfers goods is bound in like circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(4) An assignment of a right to a sub-assignee does not operate as an assignment of the assignee&#8217;s rights under his assignor&#8217;s warranties un- less an intention is manifested to assign the rights under the warranties.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 4. EFFECT ON THE OBLIGOR&#8217;S DUTY</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 334. Variation of Obligor&#8217;s Duty by Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the obligor&#8217;s duty is conditional on the personal cooperation of the original obligee or another person, an assignee&#8217;s right is subject to the same condition.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the obligor&#8217;s duty is conditional on cooperation which the obli- gee could properly delegate to an agent, the condition may occur if there is similar cooperation by an assignee.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Terms of assignment.</i> Whether there is a material change in the obligor&#8217;s duty depends not only on the terms of the contract creating the duty and on the circumstances, but also on the terms of the assignment. Com- monly an assignment manifests an in- tention that the obligor render perfor- mance to the assignee rather than to the assignor. Such a change is immate- rial in the usual case of a duty to pay money, but material where personal cooperation is made a condition of the duty. Even in the latter case, however, it is at least theoretically possible to as- sign the right without departing from the requirement.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. B contracts with A to fur- nish A&#8217;s family with all the oil it shall need for the ensuing year at a fixed price. A assigns his rights un- der the contract to C. C can acquire no right against B that C&#8217;s family shall be supplied with oil, but may acquire a right that A&#8217;s family shall be supplied, if such is the intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. B contracts with A to serve A as a valet. A, for value, assigns his rights under the contract to C. C acquires no right to have B act as valet to C. If the assignment mani- fests an intent to give C a right to have B act as valet to A, C acquires such a right. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 335. Assignment by a Joint Obligee</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A joint obligee may effectively assign his right, but the assignee can en- force it only in the same manner and to the same extent as the assignor could have enforced it.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 336. Defenses Against an Assignee</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) By an assignment the assignee acquires a right against the ob- ligor only to the extent that the obligor is under a duty to the assignor; and if the right of the assignor would be voidable by the obligor or unen- forceable against him if no assignment had been made, the right of the assignee is subject to the infirmity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) The right of an assignee is subject to any defense or claim of the obligor which accrues before the obligor receives notification of the as- signment, but not to defenses or claims which accrue thereafter except as stated in this Section or as provided by statute.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where the right of an assignor is subject to discharge or modifica- tion in whole or in part by impossibility, illegality, non-occurrence of a condition, or present or prospective failure of performance by an obligee, the right of the assignee is to that extent subject to discharge or modifica- tion even after the obligor receives notification of the assignment.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) An assignee&#8217;s right against the obligor is subject to any defense or claim arising from his conduct or to which he was subject as a party or a prior assignee because he had notice.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Accrued defenses.</i> Un- like the negotiation of a negotiable instrument, the assignment of a non- negotiable contractual right ordinar- ily transfers what the assignor has but only what he has. The assignee&#8217;s right depends on the validity and en- forceability of the contract creating the right, and is subject to limitations imposed by the terms of that contract and to defenses which would have been available against the obligee had there been no assignment. Until the obligor receives notification of an assignment, he is entitled to treat the obligee as owner of the right, and the assignee&#8217;s right is subject to defenses and claims arising from dealings between assignor and obligor in relation to the contract before notification. See &#167; 338. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Estoppel.</i> Even though an obli- gor&#8217;s agreement not to assert a defense or claim is not binding or is voidable or unenforceable, he may be estopped to assert the claim or defense against an assignee. Where he makes a repre- sentation of fact with the intention of inducing an assignee or prospective as- signee to act in reliance on the repre- sentation, and an assignee does so act, the doctrine of estoppel bars the obli- gor from contradicting the representa- tion in litigation against the assignee if contradiction would be inequitable. Compare &#167; 90. Application of the doc- trine depends on all the circumstances. The representation may be express or it may be implied from conduct, in un- usual cases even from failure to act. In some circumstances estoppel may rest on the obligor&#8217;s reason to know that the assignee may rely, even though there is no intention to induce reliance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Conduct of the assignee.</i> The conduct of the assignee or his agents may, like that of any obligee, give rise to defenses and claims which may be asserted against him by the obligor. An obligee who is subject to such a defense or claim cannot improve his position by assigning the right to an assignee who is not subject to the defense or claim and then taking a reassignment.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 337. Elimination of Defenses by Subsequent Events</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where the right of an assignor is limited or voidable or unenforceable or subject to discharge or modification, subsequent events which would eliminate the limitation or defense have the same effect on the right of the assignee.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 338. Discharge of an Obligor After Assignment</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as stated in this Section, notwithstanding an assignment, the assignor retains his power to discharge or modify the duty of the obli- gor to the extent that the obligor performs or otherwise gives value until but not after the obligor receives notification that the right has been as- signed and that performance is to be rendered to the assignee.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) So far as an assigned right is conditional on the performance of a return promise, and notwithstanding notification of the assignment, any modification of or substitution for the contract made by the assignor and obligor in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards is effective against the assignee. The assignee acquires corre- sponding rights under the modified or substituted contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Notwithstanding a defect in the right of an assignee, he has the same power his assignor had to discharge or modify the duty of the ob- ligor to the extent that the obligor gives value or otherwise changes his position in good faith and without knowledge or reason to know of the defect.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Where there is a writing of a type customarily accepted as a sym- bol or as evidence of the right assigned, a discharge or modification is not effective</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) against the owner or an assignor having a power of avoidance, unless given by him or by a person in possession of the writing with his consent and any necessary indorsement or assignment;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) against a subsequent assignee who takes possession of the writing and gives value in good faith and without knowledge or reason to know of the discharge or modification.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 339. Protection of Obligor in Cases of Adverse Claims</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a claim adverse to that of an assignee subjects the obligor to a sub- stantial risk beyond that imposed on him by his contract, the obligor will be granted such relief as is equitable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 5. PRIORITIES BETWEEN ASSIGNEE AND ADVERSE CLAIMANTS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 340. Effect of Assignment on Priority and Security</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An assignee is entitled to priority of payment from the obligor&#8217;s insolvent estate to the extent that the assignor would have been so en- titled in the absence of assignment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where an assignor holds collateral as security for the assigned right and does not effectively transfer the collateral to the assignee, the assignor is a constructive trustee of the collateral for the assignee in accordance <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>with the rules stated for pledges in &#167;&#167; 29&#8211;34 of the Restatement of Security.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 341. Creditors of an Assignor</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Except as provided by statute, the right of an assignee is superior to a judicial lien subsequently obtained against the property of the as- signor, unless the assignment is ineffective or revocable or is voidable by the assignor or by the person obtaining the lien or is in fraud of creditors.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Notwithstanding the superiority of the right of an assignee, an obligor who does not receive notification of the assignment until after he has lost his opportunity to assert the assignment as a defense in the proceeding in which the judicial lien was obtained is discharged from his duty to the assignee to the extent of his satisfaction of the lien.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Priority of assignee.</i> An effec- tive assignment extinguishes the as- signor&#8217;s right without any notification of the obligor. Any proceeds of the as- signed right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee. See Restatement of Restitution &#167; 165. A creditor of the assignor who claims the assigned right by garnishment, levy of execution or like process is not a bona fide purchas- er, even though he has no notice of the assignment. Unless protected by stat- ute or by estoppel or like doctrine, he is subject to the assignee&#8217;s right. Com- pare &#167; 342; see Restatement of Resti- tution &#167; 173. &#8220;Judicial lien,&#8221; as used in this Section, has the same meaning as it does in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Defective assignment.</i> An as- signor&#8217;s trustee in bankruptcy can in general reach all of the assignor&#8217;s legal or equitable interest in any of his prop- erty, including powers that he might have exercised for his own benefit and property transferred by him in fraud of creditors. See Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 541(a), (b), 548 (1978). In addition, a person against whom a transfer is voidable can reach the property transferred. In such cas- es, therefore, the assignee&#8217;s right is not superior to that of the lien obtained by garnishment or like process. A re- vocable gratuitous assignment, for ex- ample, does not limit the power of the assignor&#8217;s creditors to levy on the as- signed claim. See &#167; 332.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Protection of obligor.</i> An obli- gor garnished by a creditor of the as- signor cannot safely pay even in re- sponse to a judgment if he has received notification of the assignment, but he is entitled to protection against double liability by interpleader or like remedy. See &#167; 339. If the garnished obligor has not received notification, the assignee&#8217;s right against him is discharged to the same extent as the assignor&#8217;s right would have been in the absence of as- signment. See &#167;&#167; 336, 338.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Such a discharge of the obligor does not necessarily terminate the assign- ee&#8217;s rights against the assignor and the garnishing creditor. The assignee is entitled to restitution from the as- signor to the extent that the assignor has been unjustly enriched by the dis- charge of his debt. See Restatement of Restitution &#167; 118. The garnishing cred- itor takes free of the assignee&#8217;s right to the extent that he becomes a bona fide purchaser or that the assignee is barred by estoppel, laches, res judicata, or other defense. See Restatement of Restitution &#167;&#167; 131, 173, 179.</p>

The motion should be granted, and C is entitled to judgment against B to the exclusion of X.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Filing statutes.</i> Creditors are commonly among the beneficiaries of statutes requiring public filing of no- tices of certain types of transactions. The Uniform Commercial Code makes a general requirement of filing to &#8220;per- fect&#8221; a nonpossessory &#8220;security inter- est&#8221; in personal property, including &#8220;any sale of accounts or chattel paper.&#8221; See &#167;&#167; 9&#8211;102, 9&#8211;302. An unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of &#8220;a person who becomes a lien creditor before the security interest is perfected.&#8221; See &#167; 9&#8211;301. Transfers of wage claims, rights under insurance policies or deposit accounts, and vari- ous other transactions are excluded from coverage. See &#167; 9&#8211;104. With re- spect to certain international open accounts receivable, &#167; 9&#8211;103(3)(c) provides alternatives of the applica- tion of the filing law of the American jurisdiction in which the debtor has its executive offices or perfection &#8220;by noti- fication to the account debtor.&#8221; Wage assignment statutes also often provide for public filing or for notification of the obligor or both.

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 346. Availability of Damages</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The injured party has a right to damages for any breach by a party against whom the contract is enforceable unless the claim for dam- ages has been suspended or discharged.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the breach caused no loss or if the amount of the loss is not proved under the rules stated in this Chapter, a small sum fixed without regard to the amount of loss will be awarded as nominal damages.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Right to damages.</i> Every breach of contract gives the injured party a right to damages against the party in breach, unless the contract is not enforceable against that party, as where he is not bound because of the Statute of Frauds. The resulting claim may be one for damages for to- tal breach of one for damages for only partial breach. See &#167; 236. Although a judgment awarding a sum of money as damages is the most common judicial remedy for breach of contract, other remedies, including equitable relief in the form of specific performance or an injunction, may be also available, depending on the circumstances. See Topic 3. In the exceptional situation of a contract for transfer of an inter- est in land that is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, action in reli- ance makes the contract enforceable by specific performance even though it gives rise to no claim for damages for breach. See Comment c to &#167; 129. A duty to pay damages may be suspended or discharged by agreement or otherwise, and if it is discharged the claim for dam- ages is extinguished. See Introductory Note to Chapter 12. When this hap- pens, the right to enforcement by other means such as specific performance or an injunction is also extinguished. If the duty of performance, as distin- guished from the duty to pay damages, has been suspended or discharged, as by impracticability of performance or frustration of purpose, there is then no breach and this Section is not applica- ble.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>The parties can by agreement vary the rules stated in this Section, as long as the agreement is not invalid for unconscionability (&#167; 208) or on other grounds. The agreement may provide for a remedy such as repair or replace- ment in substitution for damages. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;719.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Nominal damages.</i> Although a breach of contract by a party against whom it is enforceable always gives rise to a claim for damages, there are instances in which the breach causes no loss. See Illustration 1. There are also instances in which loss is caused but recovery for that loss is precluded because it cannot be proved with rea- sonable certainty or because of one of the other limitations stated in this Chapter. See &#167;&#167; 350&#8211;53. In all these instances the injured party will nev- ertheless get judgment for nominal damages, a small sum usually fixed by judicial practice in the jurisdiction in which the action is brought. Such a judgment may, in the discretion of the court, carry with it an award of court costs. Costs are generally awarded if a significant right was involved or the claimant made a good faith effort to prove damages, but not if the mainte- nance of the action was frivolous or in bad faith. Unless a significant right is involved, a court will not reverse and remand a case for a new trial if only nominal damages could result.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to sell to B 1,000 shares of stock in X Corpora- tion for $10 a share to be delivered on June 1, but breaks the contract by refusing on that date to deliver the stock. B sues A for damages, but at trial it is proved that B could have purchased 1,000 shares of stock in X Corporation on the mar- ket on June 1 for $10 a share and therefore has suffered no loss. In an action by B against A, B will be awarded nominal damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Beneficiaries of gift promises.</i> If a promisee makes a contract, intend- ing to give a third party the benefit of the promised performance, the third party may be an intended beneficiary who is entitled to enforce the contract. See &#167; 302(1)(b). Such a gift promise creates overlapping duties, one to the beneficiary and the other to the prom- isee. If the performance is not forth- coming, both the beneficiary and the promisee have claims for damages for breach. If the promisee seeks damages, however, he will usually be limited to nominal damages: although the loss to the beneficiary may be substantial, the promisee cannot recover for that loss and he will ordinarily have suffered no loss himself. In such a case the remedy of specific performance will often be an appropriate one for the promisee. See &#167; 307.</p>

In an action by A&#8217;s personal represen- tative against B, the representa- tive can get a judgment for nominal damages.

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 347. Measure of Damages in General</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Subject to the limitations stated in &#167;&#167; 350&#8211;53, the injured party has a right to damages based on his expectation interest as measured by</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) the loss in the value to him of the other party&#8217;s performance caused by its failure or deficiency, plus</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) any other loss, including incidental or consequential loss, caused by the breach, less</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) any cost or other loss that he has avoided by not having to perform.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Expectation interest.</i> Contract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party&#8217;s expectation interest and are intended to give him the ben- efit of his bargain by awarding him a sum of money that will, to the extent possible, put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the con- tract been performed. See &#167; 344(1)(a). In some situations the sum awarded will do this adequately as, for example, where the injured party has simply had to pay an additional amount to ar- range a substitute transaction and can be adequately compensated by dam- ages based on that amount. In other situations the sum awarded cannot ad- equately compensate the injured party for his disappointed expectation as, for example, where a delay in performance has caused him to miss an invaluable opportunity. The measure of damages stated in this Section is subject to the agreement of the parties, as where they provide for liquidated damages (&#167; 356) or exclude liability for consequential damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Loss in value.</i> The first ele- ment that must be estimated in at- tempting to fix a sum that will fairly represent the expectation interest is the loss in the value to the injured par- ty of the other party&#8217;s performance that is caused by the failure of, or deficiency in, that performance. If no performance is rendered, the loss in value caused by the breach is equal to the value that the performance would have had to the injured party. If defective or partial performance is rendered, the loss in value caused by the breach is equal to the difference between the value that the performance would have had if there had been no breach and the val- ue of such performance as was actually rendered. In principle, this requires a determination of the values of those performances to the injured party him- self and not their values to some hypo- thetical reasonable person or on some market. They therefore depend on his own particular circumstances or those of his enterprise, unless consideration of these circumstances is precluded by the limitation of foreseeability (&#167; 351). Where the injured party&#8217;s expected ad- vantage consists largely or exclusively of the realization of profit, it may be possible to express this loss in value in terms of money with some assurance. In other situations, however, this is not possible and compensation for lost value may be precluded by the limita- tion of certainty. See &#167; 352. In order to facilitate the estimation of loss with sufficient certainty to award damages, the injured party is sometimes given a choice between alternative bases of calculating his loss in value. The most important of these are stated in &#167; 348. See also &#167;&#167; 349 and 373.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Other loss.</i> Subject to the limi- tations stated in &#167;&#167; 350&#8211;53, the injured party is entitled to recover for all loss actually suffered. Items of loss other than loss in value of the other party&#8217;s performance are often characterized as incidental or consequential. Incidental losses include costs incurred in a rea- sonable effort, whether successful or not, to avoid loss, as where a party pays brokerage fees in arranging or attempt- ing to arrange a substitute transac- tion. Consequential losses include such items as injury to person or property <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>resulting from defective performance. The terms used to describe the type of loss are not, however, controlling, and the general principle is that all losses, however described, are recoverable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Cost or other loss avoided.</i> Sometimes the breach itself results in a saving of some cost that the injured party would have incurred if he had had to perform. See Illustration 5. Fur- thermore, the injured party is expected to take reasonable steps to avoid fur- ther loss. See &#167; 350. Where he does this by discontinuing his own performance, he avoids incurring additional costs of performance. See Illustration 6. This cost avoided is subtracted from the loss in value caused by the breach in calcu- lating his damages. If the injured party avoids further loss by making substi- tute arrangements for the use of his resources that are no longer needed to perform the contract, the net profit from such arrangements is also subtracted. The value to him of any salvageable materials that he has acquired for per- formance is also subtracted. See Illus- tration 7. Loss avoided is subtracted only if the saving results from the in- jured party not having to perform rath- er than from some unrelated event. If no cost or other loss has been avoided, however, the injured party&#8217;s damages include the full amount of the loss in value with no subtraction, subject to the limitations stated in &#167;&#167; 350&#8211;53. The intended &#8220;donee&#8221; beneficiary of a gift promise usually suffers loss to the full extent of the value of the promised performance, since he is ordinarily not required to do anything, and so avoids no cost on breach. See &#167; 302(1)(b).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">&#8230; 5. A contracts to build a hotel for B for $500,000 and to have it ready for occupancy by May 1. B&#8217;s occupancy of the hotel is delayed for a month because of a breach by A. The cost avoided by B as a result of not having to operate the hotel dur- ing May is subtracted from the May rent lost in determining B&#8217;s dam- ages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000. When it is partly built, B repudiates the contract and A stops work. A would have to spend $60,000 more to fin- ish the house. The $60,000 cost avoided by A as a result of not hav- ing to finish the house is subtract- ed from the $100,000 price lost in determining A&#8217;s damages. A has a right to $40,000 in damages from B, less any progress payments that he has already received.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being other- wise as stated in Illustration 6, A has bought materials that are left over and that he can use for other purposes, saving him $5,000. The $5,000 cost avoided is subtracted in determining A&#8217;s damages, resulting in damages of only $35,000 rather than $40,000. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Actual loss caused by breach.</i> The injured party is limited to dam- ages based on his actual loss caused by the breach. If he makes an especially favorable substitute transaction, so that he sustains a smaller loss than might have been expected, his damages are reduced by the loss avoided as a re- sult of that transaction. If he arranges a substitute transaction that he would not have been expected to do under the rules on avoidability (&#167; 350), his dam- ages are similarly limited by the loss so avoided. Recovery can be had only for loss that would not have occurred but for the breach. See &#167; 346. If, after the breach, an event occurs that would have discharged the party in breach on grounds of impracticability of perfor- mance or frustration of purpose, dam- ages are limited to the loss sustained prior to that event. Compare &#167; 254(2). The principle that a party&#8217;s liability is not reduced by payments or other ben- efits received by the injured party from <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>collateral sources is less compelling in the case of a breach of contract than in the case of a tort. The effect of the receipt of unemployment benefits by a discharged employee will turn on the court&#8217;s perception of legislative policy rather than on the rule stated in this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Lost volume.</i> Whether a sub- sequent transaction is a substitute for the broken contract sometimes raises difficult questions of fact. If the injured party could and would have entered into the subsequent contract, even if the contract had not been broken, and could have had the benefit of both, he can be said to have &#8220;lost volume&#8221; and the subsequent transaction is not a substitute for the broken contract. The injured party&#8217;s damages are then based on the net profit that he has lost as a result of the broken contract. Since en- trepreneurs try to operate at optimum capacity, however, it is possible that an additional transaction would not have been profitable and that the injured party would not have chosen to expand his business by undertaking it had there been no breach. It is sometimes assumed that he would have done so, but the question is one of fact to be re- solved according to the circumstances of each case. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;708(2).</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 348. Alternatives to Loss in Value of Performance</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If a breach delays the use of property and the loss in value to the injured party is not proved with reasonable certainty, he may recover damages based on the rental value of the property or on interest on the value of the property.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a breach results in defective or unfinished construction and the loss in value to the injured party is not proved with sufficient certainty, he may recover damages based on</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the diminution in the market price of the property caused by the breach, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the reasonable cost of completing performance or of remedying the defects if that cost is not clearly disproportionate to the probable loss in value to him.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If a breach is of a promise conditioned on a fortuitous event and it is uncertain whether the event would have occurred had there been no breach, the injured party may recover damages based on the value of the conditional right at the time of breach.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Reason for alternative bases.</i> Although in principle the injured party is entitled to recover based on the loss in value to him caused by the breach, in practice he may be precluded from recovery on this basis because he can- not show the loss in value to him with sufficient certainty. See &#167; 352. In such a case, if there is a reasonable alterna- tive to loss in value, he may claim dam- ages based on that alternative. This Section states the rules that have been developed for three such cases.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Breach that delays the use of property.</i> If the breach is one that pre- vents for a period of time the use of property from which profits would have been made, the loss in value to the in- jured party is based on the profits that he would have made during that pe- riod. If those profits cannot be proved <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>with reasonable certainty (&#167; 352), two other bases for recovery are possible. One is the fair rental value of the prop- erty during the period of delay. Dam- ages based on fair rental value include an element of profit since the fair rent- al value of property depends on what it would command on the market and this turns on the profit that would be derived from its use. For this reason, uncertainty as to profits may result in uncertainty in fair rental value. An- other possible basis for recovery, as a last resort, is the interest on the value of the property that has been made un- productive by the breach, if that value can be shown with reasonable certain- ty. Although these two other bases will ordinarily give a smaller recovery than loss in value, it is always open to the party in breach to show that this is not so and to hold the injured party to a smaller recovery based on loss in value to him.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts with B to con- struct an outdoor drive-in theatre, to be completed by June 1. A does not complete the work until Sep- tember 1. If B cannot prove his lost profits with reasonable certainty, he can recover damages based on the rental value of the theatre prop- erty or based on the interest on the value of the theatre property itself if he can prove either of these val- ues with reasonable certainty. See Illustration 2 to &#167; 352.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Incomplete or defective perfor- mance.</i> If the contract is one for con- struction, including repair or similar performance affecting the condition of property, and the work is not finished, the injured party will usually find it easier to prove what it would cost to have the work completed by another contractor than to prove the difference between the values to him of the fin- ished and the unfinished performance. Since the cost to complete is usually less than the loss in value to him, he is limited by the rule on avoidability to damages based on cost to complete. See &#167; 350(1). If he has actually had the work completed, damages will be based on his expenditures if he comes within the rule stated in &#167; 350(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sometimes, especially if the per- formance is defective as distinguished from incomplete, it may not be possible to prove the loss in value to the injured party with reasonable certainty. In that case he can usually recover dam- ages based on the cost to remedy the defects. Even if this gives him a recov- ery somewhat in excess of the loss in value to him, it is better that he receive a small windfall than that he be under- compensated by being limited to the re- sulting diminution in the market price of his property.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sometimes, however, such a large part of the cost to remedy the defects consists of the cost to undo what has been improperly done that the cost to remedy the defects will be clearly dis- proportionate to the probable loss in value to the injured party. Damages based on the cost to remedy the defects would then give the injured party a re- covery greatly in excess of the loss in value to him and result in a substan- tial windfall. Such an award will not be made. It is sometimes said that the award would involve &#8220;economic waste,&#8221; but this is a misleading expression since an injured party will not, even if awarded an excessive amount of dam- ages, usually pay to have the defects remedied if to do so will cost him more than the resulting increase in value to him. If an award based on the cost to remedy the defects would clearly be ex- cessive and the injured party does not prove the actual loss in value to him, damages will be based instead on the difference between the market price that the property would have had with- out the defects and the market price of the property with the defects. This diminution in market price is the least <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>possible loss in value to the injured party, since he could always sell the property on the market even if it had no special value to him.</p>

B&#8217;s damages include the $80,000 cost to complete the work less the $60,000 cost avoided or $20,000, together with damages for any loss caused by delay. See Illustration 12 to &#167; 347.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000. When it is completed, the foundations crack, leaving part of the building in a dan- gerous condition. To make it safe would require tearing down some of the walls and strengthening the foundation at a cost of $30,000 and would increase the market value of the house by $20,000. B&#8217;s damages include the $30,000 cost to remedy the defects.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A contracts to build a house for B for $100,000 according to specifications that include the use of Reading pipe. After comple- tion, B discovers that A has used Cohoes pipe, an equally good brand. To replace the Cohoes pipe with Reading pipe would require tearing down part of the walls at a cost of over $20,000 and would not affect the market price of the house. In an action by B against A, A gives no proof of any special value that Reading pipe would have to him. B&#8217;s damages do not include the $20,000 cost to remedy the defects because that cost is clearly disproportionate to the loss in value to B. B can re- cover only nominal damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Fortuitous event as condition.</i> In the case of a promise conditioned on a fortuitous event (see Comment a to &#167; 379), a breach that occurs before the happening of the fortuitous event may make it impossible to determine whether the event would have occurred had there been no breach. It would be unfair to the party in breach to award damages on the assumption that the event would have occurred, but equal- ly unfair to the injured party to deny recovery of damages on the ground of uncertainty. The injured party has, in any case, the remedy of restitution (see &#167; 373). Under the rule stated in Subsection (3) he also has the alterna- tive remedy of damages based on the value of his conditional contract right at the time of breach, or what may be described as the value of his &#8220;chance of winning.&#8221; The value of that right must itself be proved with reasonable cer- tainty, as it may be if there is a market for such rights or if there is a suitable basis for determining the probability of the occurrence of the event.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The rule stated in this Subsection is limited to aleatory promises and does not apply if the promise is conditioned on some event, such as return perfor- mance by the injured party, that is not fortuitous. If, for example, an owner re- pudiates a contract to pay for repairs to be done by a contractor and then main- tains that the contractor could not or would not have done the work had he not repudiated, the contractor must prove that he could and would have performed. If he fails to do this, he has no remedy in damages. He is not en- titled to claim damages under the rule stated in Subsection (3).</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Requirement of foreseeability.</i> A contracting party is generally expect- ed to take account of those risks that are foreseeable at the time he makes the contract. He is not, however, liable in the event of breach for loss that he did not at the time of contracting have reason to foresee as a probable result of such a breach. The mere circumstance that some loss was foreseeable, or even that some loss of the same general kind was foreseeable, will not suffice if the loss that actually occurred was not foreseeable. It is enough, however, that the loss was foreseeable as a probable, as distinguished from a necessary, re- sult of his breach. Furthermore, the party in breach need not have made a &#8220;tacit agreement&#8221; to be liable for the loss. Nor must he have had the loss in mind when making the contract, for the test is an objective one based on what he had reason to foresee. There <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>is no requirement of foreseeability with respect to the injured party. In spite of these qualifications, the requirement of foreseeability is a more severe limita- tion of liability than is the requirement of substantial or &#8220;proximate&#8221; cause in the case of an action in tort or for breach of warranty. Compare Restate- ment, Second, Torts &#167; 431; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;715(2)(b). Al- though the recovery that is precluded by the limitation of foreseeability is usually based on the expectation inter- est and takes the form of lost profits (see Illustration 1), the limitation may also preclude recovery based on the re- liance interest (see Illustration 2).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A, a carrier, contracts with B, a miller, to carry B&#8217;s broken crankshaft to its manufacturer for repair. B tells A when they make the contract that the crankshaft is part of B&#8217;s milling machine and that it must be sent at once, but not that the mill is stopped because B has no replacement. Because A delays in carrying the crankshaft, B loses profit during an additional period while the mill is stopped because of the delay. A is not liable for B&#8217;s loss of profit. That loss was not foresee- able by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made because A did not know that the broken crankshaft was neces- sary for the operation of the mill.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to sell land to B and to give B possession on a stated date. Because A delays a short time in giving B possession, B incurs un- usual expenses in providing for cat- tle that he had already purchased to stock the land as a ranch. A had no reason to know when they made the contract that B had planned to purchase cattle for this purpose. A is not liable for B&#8217;s expenses in pro- viding for the cattle because that loss was not foreseeable by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. &#8220;General&#8221; and &#8220;special&#8221; dam- ages.</i> Loss that results from a breach in the ordinary course of events is fore- seeable as the probable result of the breach. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;714(1). Such loss is sometimes said to be the &#8220;natural&#8221; result of the breach, in the sense that its occurrence accords with the common experience of ordi- nary persons. For example, a seller of a commodity to a wholesaler usually has reason to foresee that his failure to deliver the commodity as agreed will probably cause the wholesaler to lose a reasonable profit on it. See Illustra- tions 3 and 4. Similarly, a seller of a machine to a manufacturer usually has reason to foresee that his delay in delivering the machine as agreed will probably cause the manufacturer to lose a reasonable profit from its use, although courts have been somewhat more cautious in allowing the manu- facturer recovery for loss of such profits than in allowing a middleman recovery for loss of profits on an intended resale. See Illustration 5. The damages recov- erable for such loss that results in the ordinary course of events are some- times called &#8220;general&#8221; damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">If loss results other than in the or- dinary course of events, there can be no recovery for it unless it was fore- seeable by the party in breach because of special circumstances that he had reason to know when he made the con- tract. See Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;715(2)(a). For example, a seller who fails to deliver a commodity to a wholesaler is not liable for the whole- saler&#8217;s loss of profit to the extent that it is extraordinary nor for his loss due to unusual terms in his resale contracts unless the seller had reason to know of these special circumstances. See Illus- tration 6. Similarly, a seller who delays in delivering a machine to a manufac- turer is not liable for the manufactur- er&#8217;s loss of profit to the extent that it <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>results from an intended use that was abnormal unless the seller had reason to know of this special circumstance. See Illustration 7. In the case of a writ- ten agreement, foreseeability is some- times established by the use of recit- als in the agreement itself. The parol evidence rule (&#167; 213) does not, however, preclude the use of negotiations prior to the making of the contract to show for this purpose circumstances that were then known to a party. The damages recoverable for loss that results other than in the ordinary course of events are sometimes called &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;con- sequential&#8221; damages. These terms are often misleading, however, and it is not necessary to distinguish between &#8220;gen- eral&#8221; and &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;consequential&#8221; damages for the purpose of the rule stated in this Section.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">3. A and B make a written contract under which A is to recon- dition by a stated date a used ma- chine owned by B so that it will be suitable for sale by B to C. A knows when they make the contract that B has contracted to sell the machine to C but knows nothing of the terms of B&#8217;s contract with C. Because A delays in returning the machine to B, B is unable to sell it to C and loses the profit that he would have made on that sale. B&#8217;s loss of rea- sonable profit was foreseeable by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, a manufacturer of ma- chines, contracts to make B his exclusive selling agent in a speci- fied area for the period of a year. Because A fails to deliver any ma- chines, B loses the profit on con- tracts that he would have made for their resale. B&#8217;s loss of reasonable profit was foreseeable by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A and B make a contract under which A is to recondition by a stated date a used machine owned by B so that it will be suitable for use in B&#8217;s canning factory. A knows that the machine must be recondi- tioned by that date if B&#8217;s factory is to operate at full capacity during the canning season, but nothing is said of this in the written contract. Because A delays in returning the machine to B, B loses its use for the entire canning season and loses the profit that he would have made had his factory operated at full ca- pacity. B&#8217;s loss of reasonable profit was foreseeable by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, the profit that B would have made under his contract with A was extraordinarily large because C promised to pay an exceptionally high price as a result of a special need for the machine of which A was unaware. A is not lia- ble for B&#8217;s loss of profit to the extent that it exceeds what would ordinar- ily result from such a contract. To that extent the loss was not foresee- able by A as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, the profit that B would have made from the use of the machine was unusually large because of an abnormal use to which he planned to put it of which A was unaware. A is not liable for B&#8217;s loss of profit to the extent that it exceeds what would ordinarily result from the use of such a ma- chine. To that extent the loss was not foreseeable by A at the time the contract was made as a probable re- sult of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Litigation or settlement caused by breach.</i> Sometimes a breach of contract <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>results in claims by third persons against the injured party. The party in breach is liable for the amount of any judgment against the injured party together with his reasonable expen- ditures in the litigation, if the party in breach had reason to foresee such expenditures as the probable result of his breach at the time he made the contract. See Illustrations 8, 10, 11 and 12. This is so even if the judgment in the litigation is based on a liquidated damage clause in the injured party&#8217;s contract with the third party. See Illus- tration 8. A failure to notify the party in breach in advance of the litigation may prevent the result of the litigation from being conclusive as to him. But to the extent that the injured party&#8217;s loss resulting from litigation is reason- able, the fact that the party in breach was not notified does not prevent the inclusion of that loss in the damages assessed against him. In furtherance of the policy favoring private settle- ment of disputes, the injured party is also allowed to recover the reasonable amount of any settlement made to avoid litigation, together with the costs of settlement. See Illustration 9.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">8. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, B not only loses the profit that he would have made on sale of the machine to C, but is held liable for damages in an action brought by C for breach of contract. The damages paid to C and B&#8217;s reasonable expenses in de- fending the action were also fore- seeable by A as a probable result of the breach at the time he made the contract with B. The result is the same even though they were based on a liquidated damage clause in the contract between B and C if A knew of the clause or if the use of such a clause in the contract be- tween B and C was foreseeable by A at the time he made the contract with B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, B not only loses the profit that he would have made on sale of the machine to C, but settles with C by paying C a reasonable sum of money to avoid litigation. The amount of the settle- ment paid to C and B&#8217;s reasonable expenses in settling were also fore- seeable by A at the time he made the contract with B as a probable result of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. A contracts to supply B with machinery for unloading cargo. A, in breach of contract, furnishes defective machinery, and C, an em- ployee of B, is injured. C sues B and gets a judgment, which B pays. The amount of the judgment and B&#8217;s reasonable expenditures in defend- ing the action were foreseeable by A at the time the contract was made as a probable result of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. A contracts to procure a right of way for B, for a railroad. Be- cause A, in breach of contract, fails to do this, B has to acquire the right of way by condemnation proceed- ings.

<p class="comment_indent1">12. A leases land to B with a covenant for quiet enjoyment. C brings an action of ejectment against B and gets judgment. B&#8217;s reasonable expenditures in defend- ing the action were foreseeable by A as the probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Unavailability of substitute.</i> If several circumstances have contrib- uted to cause a loss, the party in breach is not liable for it unless he had reason to foresee all of them. Sometimes a loss would not have occurred if the injured party had been able to make substitute arrangements after breach, as, for ex- ample, by &#8220;cover&#8221; through purchase of <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>substitute goods in the case of a buyer of goods (see Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;712). If the inability of the injured party to make such arrangements was foreseeable by the party in breach at the time he made the contract, the re- sulting loss was foreseeable. See Illus- tration 13. On the impact of this prin- ciple on contracts to lend money, see Comment e.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">13. A contracts with B, a farm- er, to lease B a machine to be used harvesting B&#8217;s crop, delivery to be made on July 30. A knows when he makes the contract that B&#8217;s crop will be ready on that date and that B cannot obtain another machine elsewhere. Because A delays deliv- ery until August 10, B&#8217;s crop is dam- aged and he loses profit. B&#8217;s loss of profit was foreseeable by A at the time the contract was made as a probable result of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Breach of contract to lend money.</i> The limitation of foreseeability is often applied in actions for damages for breach of contracts to lend money. Because credit is so widely available, a lender often has no reason to foresee at the time the contract is made that the borrower will be unable to make sub- stitute arrangements in the event of breach. See Comment d. In most cases, then, the lender&#8217;s liability will be lim- ited to the relatively small additional amount that it would ordinarily cost to get a similar loan from another lender. However, in the less common situation in which the lender has reason to fore- see that the borrower will be unable to borrow elsewhere or will be delayed in borrowing elsewhere, the lender may be liable for much heavier dam- ages based on the borrower&#8217;s inability to take advantage of a specific oppor- tunity (see Illustration 14), his having to postpone or abandon a profitable project (see Illustration 15), or his for- feiture of security for failure to make prompt payment (see Illustration 16).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">14. A contracts to lend B $100,000 for one year at eight per- cent interest for the stated purpose of buying a specific lot of goods for resale. B can resell the goods at a $20,000 profit. A delays in making the loan, and although B can bor- row money on the market at ten percent interest, he is unable to do so in time and loses the opportunity to buy the goods. Unless A had rea- son to foresee at the time that he made the contract that such a delay in making the loan would probably cause B to lose the opportunity, B can only recover damages based on two percent of the amount of the loan.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">15. A contracts to lend $1,000,000 to B for the stated pur- pose of enabling B to build a build- ing and takes property of B as secu- rity. After construction is begun, A refuses to make the loan or release the security. Because B lacks fur- ther security, he is unable to com- plete the building, which becomes a total loss. B&#8217;s loss incurred in par- tial construction of the building was foreseeable by A at the time of the contract as a probable result of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. A, who holds B&#8217;s land as security for a loan, contracts to lend B a sum of money sufficient to pay off other liens on the land at the current rate of interest. A repudi- ates and informs B in time to obtain money elsewhere on the market, but B is unable to do so. The liens are foreclosed and the land sold at a loss. Unless A knew when he made the contract that B would probably be unable to borrow the money else- where, B&#8217;s loss on the foreclosure sale was not foreseeable as a prob- able result of A&#8217;s breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>f. Other limitations on damages.</i> It is not always in the interest of justice to require the party in breach to pay damages for all of the foreseeable loss that he has caused. There are unusual instances in which it appears from the circumstances either that the parties assumed that one of them would not bear the risk of a particular loss or that, although there was no such as- sumption, it would be unjust to put the risk on that party. One such circum- stance is an extreme disproportion be- tween the loss and the price charged by the party whose liability for that loss is in question. The fact that the price is relatively small suggests that it was not intended to cover the risk of such liability. Another such circumstance is an informality of dealing, including the absence of a detailed written con- tract, which indicates that there was no careful attempt to allocate all of the risks. The fact that the parties did not attempt to delineate with precision all of the risks justifies a court in at- tempting to allocate them fairly. The limitations dealt with in this Section are more likely to be imposed in con- nection with contracts that do not arise in a commercial setting. Typical exam- ples of limitations imposed on damages under this discretionary power involve the denial of recovery for loss of profits and the restriction of damages to loss incurred in reliance on the contract. Sometimes these limits are covertly imposed, by means of an especially de- manding requirement of foreseeability or of certainty. The rule stated in this Section recognizes that what is done in such cases is the imposition of a limita- tion in the interests of justice.</p>

Delivery is delayed because A&#8217;s truck breaks down. In an action by B against A for breach of contract the court may, after taking into consideration such factors as the absence of an elaborate written con- tract and the extreme disproportion between B&#8217;s loss of profits during the delay and the price of the truck- er&#8217;s services, exclude recovery for loss of profits.</p>

In an action by B against A for breach of contract, the court may, after tak- ing into consideration such factors as the absence of an elaborate writ- ten contract and the extreme dis- proportion between B&#8217;s loss of prof- its during the delay and the price of the attachment, exclude recovery for loss of profits.</p>

In an action by B against A for breach of contract, the court may limit damages by allowing recovery only for loss incurred by B in reli- ance on the contract, including the fees paid by B and expenses for hos- pitalization, nursing care and medi- cine for both operations, together with any damages for the worsen- ing of B&#8217;s appearance if these can be proved with reasonable certainty, but not including any loss resulting from the failure to improve her ap- pearance.</p>

<p class="noindent">Damages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Requirement of certainty.</i> A party cannot recover damages for breach of a contract for loss beyond the amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable cer- tainty. See Illustration 1. Courts have traditionally required greater certainty in the proof of damages for breach of a contract than in the proof of dam- ages for a tort. The requirement does not mean, however, that the injured party is barred from recovery unless he establishes the total amount of his loss. It merely excludes those elements of loss that cannot be proved with rea- sonable certainty. The main impact of the requirement of certainty comes in connection with recovery for lost prof- its. Although the requirement of cer- tainty is distinct from that of foresee- ability (&#167; 351), its impact is similar in this respect. Although the requirement applies to damages based on the reli- ance as well as the expectation inter- est, there is usually little difficulty in proving the amount that the injured party has actually spent in reliance on the contract, even if it is impossible to prove the amount of profit that he would have made. In such a case, he can recover his loss based on his reli- ance interest instead of on his expec- tation interest. See &#167; 349 and Illustra- tions 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Doubts are generally resolved against the party in breach. A party who has, by his breach, forced the in- jured party to seek compensation in damages should not be allowed to profit from his breach where it is established that a significant loss has occurred. A court may take into account all the circumstances of the breach, includ- ing willfulness, in deciding whether to require a lesser degree of certainty, giving greater discretion to the trier of the facts. Damages need not be cal- culable with mathematical accuracy and are often at best approximate. See Comment 1 to Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 1&#8211;106. This is especially true for items such as loss of good will as to which great precision cannot be expected. See Illustration 4. Further- more, increasing receptiveness on the part of courts to proof by sophisticated economic and financial data and by ex- pert opinion has made it easier to meet the requirement of certainty.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contracts to publish a novel that B has written. A repudi- ates the contract and B is unable to get his novel published elsewhere. If the evidence does not permit B&#8217;s loss of royalties and of reputation to be estimated with reasonable certainty, he cannot recover dam- ages for that loss, although he can recover nominal damages. See Illus- tration 1 to &#167; 347.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contracts to sell B a tract of land on which B plans to build an outdoor drive-in theatre. A breaks the contract by selling the land to C, and B is unable to build the theatre. If, because of the speculative nature of the new enterprise the evidence does not permit B&#8217;s loss of profits to be estimated with reasonable cer- tainty, his recovery will be limited to expenses incurred in reliance or, if none can be proved with reason- able certainty, to nominal damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A and B make a contract under which A is to construct a building of radical new design for B for $5,000,000. After A has spent $3,000,000 in reliance, B repudiates the contract and orders A off the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>site. If the evidence does not permit A&#8217;s lost profits to be estimated with reasonable certainty, he can recover the $3,000,000 that he has spent in reliance. He must, however, then prove that amount with reasonable certainty.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A, a manufacturer, makes a contract with B, a wholesaler, to sell B a quantity of plastic. B resells the plastic to dealers. The plastic is discovered to be defective and B has many complaints from dealers, some of which refuse to place fur- ther orders with him. B can recover the loss of good will if his loss can be estimated with reasonable cer- tainty by such evidence as his busi- ness records before and after the transaction and the testimony of his salespersons and that of dealers.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Proof of profits.</i> The difficulty of proving lost profits varies greatly with the nature of the transaction. If, for example, it is the seller who claims lost profit on the ground that the buyer&#8217;s breach has caused him to lose a sale, proof of lost profit will or- dinarily not be difficult. If, however, it is the buyer who claims lost profit on the ground that the seller&#8217;s breach has caused him loss in other transactions, the task of proof is harder. Further- more, if the transaction is more com- plex and extends into the future, as where the seller agrees to furnish all of the buyer&#8217;s requirements over a pe- riod of years, proof of the loss of profits caused by the seller&#8217;s breach is more difficult. If the breach prevents the injured party from carrying on a well- established business, the resulting loss of profits can often be proved with sufficient certainty. Evidence of past performance will form the basis for a reasonable prediction as to the future. See Illustration 5. However, if the busi- ness is a new one or if it is a speculative one that is subject to great fluctuations in volume, costs or prices, proof will be more difficult. Nevertheless, damages may be established with reasonable certainty with the aid of expert testi- mony, economic and financial data, market surveys and analyses, business records of similar enterprises, and the like. See Illustration 6. Under a con- tract of exclusive agency for the sale of goods on commission, the agent can of- ten prove with sufficient certainty the profits that he would have made had he not been discharged. Proof of the sales made by the agent in the agreed terri- tory before the breach, or of the sales made there by the principal after the breach, may permit a reasonably ac- curate estimate of the agent&#8217;s loss of commissions. However, if the agency is not an exclusive one, so that the agent&#8217;s ability to withstand competi- tion is in question, such a showing will be more difficult, although the agent&#8217;s past record may give a sufficient basis for judging this. See Illustration 7.</p>

B can use evidence as to sales and profits made by him be- fore the repudiation and made by C after the repudiation in attempting to prove his lost profits with rea- sonable certainty. It would be more difficult, although not necessarily impossible, for B to succeed in this attempt if his agency were not ex- clusive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Alternative remedies.</i> The necessity of proving damages can be avoided if another remedy, such as a decree of specific performance or an injunction, is granted instead of dam- ages. Although the availability of such a remedy does not preclude an award of damages as an alternative, it may justify a court in requiring greater certainty of proof if damages are to be awarded. See Illustration 8.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">8. A, a steel manufacturer, and B, a dealer in scrap steel, con- tract for the sale by A to B of all of A&#8217;s output of scrap steel for five years at a price fixed in terms of the market price. B&#8217;s profit will depend largely on the amount of A&#8217;s output and the cost of transporting the scrap to B&#8217;s purchasers. A repudi- ates the contract at the end of one year. Whether B can recover dam- ages based on lost profits over the remaining four years will depend on whether he can prove A&#8217;s output and the transportation costs with reasonable certainty. If he can do so for part of the remaining four years, he can recover damages based on lost profits for that period. The availability of the remedy of specific performance is a factor that will in- fluence a court in requiring greater certainty.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Liquidated damages or pen- alty.</i> The parties to a contract may ef- fectively provide in advance the dam- ages that are to be payable in the event of breach as long as the provision does not disregard the principle of compen- sation. The enforcement of such pro- visions for liquidated damages saves the time of courts, juries, parties and witnesses and reduces the expense of litigation. This is especially important if the amount in controversy is small. However, the parties to a contract are not free to provide a penalty for its breach. The central objective behind the system of contract remedies is com- pensatory, not punitive. Punishment of a promisor for having broken his promise has no justification on either economic or other grounds and a term providing such a penalty is unenforce- able on grounds of public policy. See Chapter 8. The rest of the agreement remains enforceable, however, under the rule stated in &#167; 184(1), and the remedies for breach are determined by the rules stated in this Chapter. See Il- lustration 1. A term that fixes an un- reasonably small amount as damages may be unenforceable as unconscio- nable. See &#167; 208. As to the liquidation of damages and modification or limita- tion of remedies in contracts of sale, see Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;718, 2&#8211;719.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Test of penalty.</i> Under the test stated in Subsection (1), two factors combine in determining whether an amount of money fixed as damages is so unreasonably large as to be a pen- alty. The first factor is the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach. The amount fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from the par- ticular breach, even though it may not approximate the loss that might have been anticipated under other possible breaches. See Illustration 2. Further- more, the amount fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates the loss anticipated at the time of the making of the contract, even though it may not approximate the actual loss. See Illus- tration 3. The second factor is the dif- ficulty of proof of loss. The greater the difficulty either of proving that loss has occurred or of establishing its amount with the requisite certainty (see &#167; 351), the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is reasonable. To the extent that there is uncertainty as to the harm, the estimate of the court or jury may not accord with the principle of compensa- tion any more than does the advance estimate of the parties. A determina- tion whether the amount fixed is a pen- alty turns on a combination of these two factors. If the difficulty of proof of loss is great, considerable latitude is allowed in the approximation of antici- pated or actual harm. If, on the other hand, the difficulty of proof of loss is slight, less latitude is allowed in that approximation. If, to take an extreme case, it is clear that no loss at all has <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>occurred, a provision fixing a substan- tial sum as damages is unenforceable. See Illustration 4.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A and B sign a written con- tract under which A is to act in a play produced by B for a ten week season for $4,000. A term provides that &#8220;if either party shall fail to per- form as agreed in any respect he will pay $10,000 as liquidated dam- ages and not as a penalty.&#8221; A leaves the play before the last week to take another job. The play is sold out for that week and A is replaced by a suitable understudy. The amount fixed is unreasonable in the light of both the anticipated and the actual loss and, in spite of the use of the words &#8220;liquidated damages,&#8221; the term provides for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds of public policy. The rest of the agreement is enforceable (&#167; 184(1)), and B&#8217;s rem- edies for A&#8217;s breach are governed by the rules stated in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A, B and C form a partner- ship to practice veterinary medicine in a town for ten years. In the part- nership agreement, each promises that if, on the termination of the partnership, the practice is contin- ued by the other two members, he will not practice veterinary medi- cine in the same town during its continuance up to a maximum of three years. A term provides that for breach of this duty &#8220;he shall forfeit $50,000 to be collected by the others as damages. &#8220;A leaves the partner- ship, and the practice is continued by B and C. A immediately begins to practice veterinary medicine in the same town. The loss actu- ally caused to B and C is difficult of proof and $50,000 is not an unrea- sonable estimate of it. Even though $50,000 may be unreasonable in relation to the loss that might have resulted in other circumstances, it is not unreasonable in relation to the actual loss. Therefore, the term does not provide for a penalty and its enforcement is not precluded on grounds of public policy. See Illus- tration 14 to &#167; 188.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A contracts to build a grandstand for B&#8217;s race track for $1,000,000 by a specified date and to pay $1,000 a day for every day&#8217;s delay in completing it. A delays completion for ten days. If $1,000 is not unreasonable in the light of the anticipated loss and the actual loss to B is difficult to prove, A&#8217;s promise is not a term providing for a penalty and its enforcement is not preclud- ed on grounds of public policy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, B is de- layed for a month in obtaining per- mission to operate his race track so that it is certain that A&#8217;s delay of ten days caused him no loss at all. Since the actual loss to B is not difficult to prove, A&#8217;s promise is a term providing for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds of public policy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Disguised penalties.</i> Under the rule stated in this Section, the va- lidity of a term providing for damages depends on the effect of that term as interpreted according to the rules stated in Chapter 9. Neither the par- ties&#8217; actual intention as to its validity nor their characterization of the term as one for liquidated damages or a penalty is significant in determining whether the term is valid. Sometimes parties attempt to disguise a provi- sion for a penalty by using language that purports to make payment of the amount an alternative performance under the contract, that purports to of- fer a discount for prompt performance, or that purports to place a valuation on property to be delivered. Although the parties may in good faith contract for alternative performances and fix discounts <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>or valuations, a court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether this is the case or whether the parties have attempted to disguise a provision for a penalty that is unenforceable under this Section. In determining whether a contract is one for alternative performances, the rela- tive value of the alternatives may be decisive.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contracts to build a house for B for $50,000 by a speci- fied date or in the alternative to pay B $1,000 a week during any period of delay. A delays comple- tion for ten days. If $1,000 a week is unreasonable in the light of both the anticipated and actual loss, A&#8217;s promise to pay $1,000 a week is, in spite of its form, a term providing for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds of public policy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Related types of provisions.</i> This Section does not purport to cover the wide variety of provisions used by parties to control the remedies avail- able to them for breach of contract. A term that fixes as damages an amount that is unreasonably small does not come within the rule stated in this Sec- tion, but a court may refuse to enforce it as unconscionable under the rule stated in &#167; 208. A mere recital of the harm that may occur as a result of a breach of contract does not come with- in the rule stated in this Section, but may increase damages by making that harm foreseeable under the rule stated &#167; 351. As to the effect of a contract pro- vision on the right to equitable relief, see Comment a to &#167; 359. As to the ef- fect of a term requiring the occurrence of a condition where forfeiture would result, see &#167; 229. Although attorneys&#8217; fees are not generally awarded to the winning party, if the parties provide for the award of such fees the court will award a sum that it considers to be rea- sonable. If, however, the parties specify the amount of such fees, the provision is subject to the test stated in this Sec- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Penalties in bonds.</i> Bonds of- ten fix a flat sum as a penalty for non- occurrence of the condition of the bond. A term providing for a penalty is not unenforceable in its entirety but only to the extent that it exceeds the loss caused by the non-occurrence of the condition.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Degree of certainty re- quired.</i> If specific performance or an injunction is to be granted, it is impor- tant that the terms of the contract are sufficiently certain to enable the order to be drafted with precision because of the availability of the contempt power for disobedience. Before concluding that the required certainty is lack- ing, however, a court will avail itself of all of the usual aids in determining the scope of the agreement. Apparent difficulties of enforcement due to un- certainty may disappear in the light of courageous common sense. Expres- sions that at first appear incomplete may not appear so after resort to usage (&#167; 221) or the addition of a term sup- plied by law (&#167; 204). A contract is not too uncertain merely because a promi- sor is given a choice of performing in several ways, whether expressed as alternative performances or otherwise. He may be ordered to make the choice and to perform accordingly, and, if he fails to make the choice, the court may choose for him and order specific performance. Even though subsidiary terms have been left to determination by future agreement, if performance has begun by mutual consent, equi- table relief may be appropriate with the court supplying the missing terms so as to assure the promisor all advan- tages that he reasonably expected.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Specific performance or an injunction will be refused if such relief would be unfair because</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Recovery of benefit on avoid- ance.</i> A party who exercises his power of avoidance is entitled to recover in restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party through part performance of or reliance on the contract. The benefit from his part per- formance includes that resulting from the use by the other party of whatever he has received up to the time that it is returned on avoidance. Furthermore, under the rule stated in &#167; 384, a party seeking restitution must generally re- turn any benefit that he has himself received. If he has received and must return land, for example, he may have made improvements on the land in reli- ance on the contract and he is entitled, on avoidance and return of the land, to recover the reasonable value of those improvements (&#167; 371(b)). The rule stated in this Section applies to avoid- ance on any ground, including lack of capacity (&#167;&#167; 14&#8211;16), mistake (&#167;&#167; 152, 153), misrepresentation (&#167; 164), duress (&#167; 175), undue influence (&#167; 177) or abuse of a fiduciary relation (&#167; 173). Uncer- tainties in measuring the benefit, how- ever, are more likely to be resolved in favor of the party seeking restitution if the other party engaged in misconduct, as in cases of fraudulent misrepresen- tation, duress or undue influence. In cases of mental incompetency the rule stated in this Section is supplemented by that stated in &#167; 15(2) and in cases of mistake it is supplemented by that stated in &#167; 158.</p>

B disaffirms the contract for mistake (&#167; 152), tenders a deed to the land to A, and sues A for $100,000. B can recover $100,000 from A in restitution. See Illustration 1 to &#167; 152.</p>

Because B had estimated <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the expected cost as $180,000 and the 10 other bids were all in the range between $180,000 and $200,000, B had reason to know of A&#8217;s mistake. A discovers the mis- take after he has done part of the work, disaffirms the contract on the ground of mistake (&#167; 153), and sues B in restitution for the benefit con- ferred on B as measured by the rea- sonable value of A&#8217;s performance. A can recover the reasonable value of his performance in restitution and if the cost of the work done can be determined under the next lowest bid, that cost is evidence of its rea- sonable value.

<p class="indent">(2) The power of a party to avoid a contract for misrepresentation or mistake is lost if after he knows of a fraudulent misrepresentation or knows or has reason to know of a non-fraudulent misrepresentation or mistake he does not within a reasonable time manifest to the other party his intention to avoid it. The power of a party to avoid a contract for non- fraudulent misrepresentation or mistake is also lost if the contract has been so far performed or the circumstances have otherwise so changed that avoidance would be inequitable and if damages will be adequate compensation.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. The Statute of Frauds.</i> The so-called &#8220;suretyship provision&#8221; of the Statute of Frauds was included in dif- ferent language in &#167; 4 of the English Statute of Frauds, enacted in 1677. The English Statute was repealed in 1954 except for the suretyship and land contract provisions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 4 of the English statute was generally copied in the United States, and the American statutes remain in force. In Maryland and New Mexico the English statute is in force by judi- cial decision. All the other states but Louisiana have statutes similar to the English statute, with some provisions omitted in a few states:</p>

<p class="comment_indent">This section addresses the applica- bility of the Statute of Frauds to con- tracts creating secondary obligations. Satisfaction of the Statute is the sub- ject of Restatement, Contracts, Topic 6, &#167;&#167; 131&#8211;137. The consequences of noncompliance are the subject of Re- statement, Second, Contracts, Topic 7, &#167;&#167; 138&#8211;147.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. The statutory purpose.</i> In gen- eral, the primary purpose of the Statute of Frauds is assumed to be evidentiary. In the case of secondary obligations, however, the Statute also serves the cautionary function of guarding the promisor against ill-considered action. The suretyship provision of the Statute is not limited to important or complex contracts, but applies to secondary ob- ligations created by promises made to an obligee of the underlying obligation. Such promises serve a useful purpose, and the requirement of consideration is commonly met by the same promise or performance that is consideration for the principal obligation. However, other considerations militate in favor of requiring a writing: the motivation of the secondary obligor is often essen- tially gratuitous; its obligation depends on a contingency that may seem remote at the time of contracting; and natural formalities that often attend an exten- sion of credit are unlikely to provide reliable evidence of the existence and terms of the secondary obligor&#8217;s under- taking. Reliance of the kinds usual in such situations&#8212;extension of credit or forbearance to pursue the principal ob- ligor&#8212;does not render the requirement inapplicable. It should be noted that the determination of what constitutes a writing or a signature in an environment <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of electronic data transmission must continue to evolve.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. D commits a tort against C. S orally promises C to pay C the damages that C suffered from the tort if D fails to do so. S&#8217;s promise is within the Statute of Frauds be- cause D is under a direct duty to C and S&#8217;s promise is to perform D&#8217;s duty if D fails to do so.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. S orally promises C to guarantee the performance of any duty that D may incur to C within the ensuing year. Relying on this promise, C enters into a contract with D, by which D undertakes within the year to select materials for a house and to act as supervising architect during its construction. D, without excuse, fails to perform his contract. S&#8217;s promise is within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. D, an infant, obtains goods on credit from C, who is induced to part with them by S&#8217;s oral guaranty that D will pay the price as agreed. The goods are not necessaries but D is subject to a duty to pay for them, though the duty is voidable. S&#8217;s promise is within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. D, a mentally impaired person under guardianship, obtains goods on credit from C, who is in- duced to part with them by S&#8217;s oral guaranty that D will keep his prom- ise to pay the price. D&#8217;s promise is void. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute of Frauds because there is no underlying obligation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (2)(a):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Rationale.</i> Unless a contrary intention is manifested, the fact that promises of the same performance are made by two persons for a consider- ation that inures to the benefit of only one of them sufficiently shows that the other is a secondary obligor. In addi- tion, because an obligee who has reason to know that the consideration inures to the benefit of only one has reason to know of the suretyship status, the exception set forth in subsection (3)(a) does not apply.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Joint obligations.</i> Historically, joint promisors were treated for many purposes as a unit. Hence, as against one joint promisor the obligation of his co-promisor was not treated as that &#8220;of another&#8221; within the Statute of Frauds, even though a suretyship relation in fact existed between them. In modern times the historic rules governing joint obligations have been greatly modified by statute or decision in most states. See Restatement, Second, Contracts, Chapter 13. But where the distinc- tion between joint duties and joint and several duties retains significance, the suretyship provision of the Statute of Frauds does not apply to the surety- ship status between joint promisors.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6, C has no reason to know that the goods are not for the benefit of both parties. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Stat- ute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (2)(b):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Scope.</i> The promises covered by this subsection are not in terms promises to answer for a duty of anoth- er. They are promises to execute writ- ten instruments by which the promisor <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>will on signing undertake to answer for such a duty. In substance, however, such promises, if binding, subject the promisor to an action if the perfor- mance due from the principal obligor is not rendered. This subsection is appli- cable whether the promise relates to an existing duty or to one expected to arise in the future.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (2)(c):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Secondary obligation in the form of contract to purchase.</i> Ordinar- ily a promise to buy a right and a prom- ise to pay the debt of another are quite different transactions. Thus, a promise to buy does not generally result in the promisor having suretyship status and the promise is not within the surety- ship provision of the Statute of Frauds. The promise may nevertheless be with- in other Statute of Fraud provisions, particularly Uniform Commercial Code &#167;&#167; 1&#8211;206, 9&#8211;203 (1995). See Restate- ment, Second, Contracts &#167; 110. Where, however, a promise to buy a debt is conditional on the debtor&#8217;s actual or potential default and the amount to be paid is essentially the same as if the debt had been guaranteed, the promi- sor is a secondary obligor with surety- ship status and the promise is within the suretyship provision of the Statute of Frauds. The distinction between a contract to buy in which the promisor has suretyship status and one in which the promisor does not have that status does not lie in any formal difference in the words used but in the reality of the transaction. For the purposes of the Statute of Frauds, the test is whether in all the circumstances the essential purpose of the promise is to protect the promisee against the actual or poten- tial nonperformance of the debtor by giving the promisee recourse against the promisor. Compare &#167; 1, Comment h and Illustrations 13&#8211;14.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. D corporation owes C $1,000, which is due. S orally prom- ises C that if C will grant D an ex- tension of 60 days, S will purchase the debt at that time if it is not then paid. The circumstances indicate that S is really guaranteeing the account, and the promise is unen- forceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (3)(a):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Promisee must be obligee; &#8220;rea- son to know.&#8221;</i> The suretyship provision does not apply to a promise unless the promisee is the obligee. Moreover, the obligee-promisee must know or have reason to know of the secondary obli- gor&#8217;s suretyship status, either from the terms of its contract with the principal obligor or the secondary obligor or from extrinsic facts.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. S, for consideration, orally promises E to pay a debt of E&#8217;s child D to C, if D fails to pay it at ma- turity. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute of Frauds because it was made to E, not to the obligee C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. In an unsigned writing, D and S severally and unconditionally promise C, for consideration inur- ing to the benefit of both D and S, that C shall be paid the sum of $100 a month for the next six months. D has induced S to make this promise by promising to hold S harmless, making S a secondary obligor. If C <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>knows or has reason to know of this contract between D and S when S makes the promise to C, S&#8217;s prom- ise is unenforceable. Otherwise S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (3)(b):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Rationale.</i> Where the second- ary obligor, if it performs the secondary obligation, will be doing no more than it is bound to do by reason of a duty other than that imposed by the secondary obligation, the promise is not within the Statute of Frauds. In such a case, even though the secondary obligor has suretyship status, the secondary obli- gor promises to answer for its own ob- ligation as well as that of another and is not within the reason of the Statute. The terms of the secondary obligation will commonly refer to the independent duty, but need not do so. The indepen- dent duty may exist when the second- ary obligation is created or may arise subsequently.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Application of funds.</i> Para- graph (3)(b)(i) deals primarily with cases where the secondary obligor is a trustee and the obligee a beneficiary of the trust, although the trust relation- ship is not essential. In such cases, the secondary obligation usually shows by its terms the independent duty and the limitation of the secondary obligation. To the extent that the secondary obli- gation goes beyond the duty, the case is not within paragraph (3)(b)(i).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. D owes C $100 and pays that sum to S in trust to pay it to C. Then or thereafter S orally prom- ises C to pay D&#8217;s debt. Whether or not C knows of the trust, C acquires an enforceable right against S.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. D pays $100 to S in trust to apply it to whatever judgment C may recover against D in an action then pending. S orally promises C to pay the judgment in full. C re- covers judgment for $125. C has an enforceable right against S for only $100.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>j. Other independent duties.</i> Where the secondary obligor merely promises to perform an independent duty owed to the obligee or to the prin- cipal obligor, the secondary obligation is not within the Statute. In such cases the terms of the secondary obligation often do not disclose the independent duty. Where the obligee in good faith believes, at the time that the secondary obligation is created, that an indepen- dent duty is owed by the secondary ob- ligor to his co-obligor, the same rule is applied even though the duty does not in fact exist.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">15. S is a member of a partner- ship. After S retires but before the debts of the partnership are paid, S orally promises C, a partnership creditor whose claim relates to a transaction predating S&#8217;s retire- ment, to pay the amount due C. The promise is not within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. S, at D&#8217;s request, orally promises C to guarantee the pay- ment by D to C of the price of any goods sold by C to D, to the extent of the indebtedness S may owe D at the time that C notifies S that D has defaulted. C thereupon sells goods to D. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. S and D severally promise C to pay for goods to be delivered to D. The goods are actually for S and D is the actual secondary obli- gor, but S and D lead C to suppose that S is the secondary obligor. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute of Frauds; under subsection (2)(a)(ii) neither is D&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment to Subsection (3)(c):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>k. Rationale.</i> This subsection states what is often called the &#8220;main purpose&#8221; or &#8220;leading object&#8221; rule. Where the secondary obligors&#8217;s main purpose is its own pecuniary or busi- ness advantage, the gratuitous or sen- timental element often present in sure- tyship is eliminated, the likelihood of disproportion in the values exchanged between secondary obligor and obligee is reduced, and the commercial context commonly provides evidentiary safe- guards. Thus, there is less need for cau- tionary or evidentiary formality than in other secondary obligations. Histori- cally, the rule could be reconciled with the terms of the Statute on the ground that a secondary obligor who received a bargained-for benefit could be sued in debt or indebitatus assumpsit; hence, it promised to pay its debt rather than the debt &#8220;of another,&#8221; and the promise was not &#8220;special&#8221; in the sense that spe- cial assumpsit was the only appropri- ate remedy. In modern times, however, the rule is applied in terms of its rea- son rather than to accord with aban- doned procedural categories.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>l. Factors affecting application of the rule.</i> The fact that there is con- sideration for the secondary obliga- tion is insufficient to bring the rule of subsection (3)(c) into play. Slight and indirect possible advantage to the sec- ondary obligor is similarly insufficient. The expected advantage must be such as to justify the conclusion that the main purpose of the secondary obligor in making the promise is to advance its own interests. The following factors tend to indicate such a main purpose when there is an expected pecuniary or business advantage: prior default; inability or repudiation of the princi- pal obligor; forbearance of the obligee to enforce a lien on property in which the secondary obligor has an interest or which it intends to use; equivalence between the value of the benefit and the amount promised; and lack of par- ticipation by the principal obligor in the making of the secondary obligor&#8217;s promise. The benefit may be supplied to the secondary obligor by the obligee, by the principal obligor, or by some oth- er person; if it is substantial and meets the main purpose test it may come in- directly through benefit to the princi- pal obligor.</p>

A promise by a third party to indemni- fy the secondary obligor against breach of these duties is, strictly speaking, a promise to answer for the default of the principal obligor in the event of the breach of its duties to the secondary obligor. Such treatment is appropriate when it accords with the understand- ing of the parties. Commonly, how- ever, the parties treat the promise to indemnify as a promise to a prospec- tive debtor rather than as a promise to a prospective creditor. So viewed, the promise is not within the Statute. See subsection (3)(h). Many such cases are also with the main purpose rule. See subsection (3)(c).

<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (3)(e):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>p. Scope.</i> An obligor of a duty may become a secondary obligor by agree- ment with another who subsequently assumes the duty, thereby becoming the principal obligor, but this will not make the original promise subject to the Statute of Frauds. The rule stated in this subsection applies, for example, where a partner retires from a partner- ship and the remaining partners agree to assume all of the partnership obli- gations. If the obligation on which the retiring partner was originally bound was oral, it does not becomes unen- forceable merely because, as between the retiring partner and the others, the retiring partner becomes a secondary obligor.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment to Subsections (3)(f) and (3)(g):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>q. Rationale.</i> The promisors re- ferred to in these subsections become secondary obligors for the debts of oth- ers, but the promises are commonly made in contexts that provide evidence of the promises and eliminate the need of cautionary formality. The assign- or&#8217;s promise that the obligor of an as- signed right will perform its obligation is ordinarily made to provide recourse against the assignor as part of the sale of that right and, thus, is for a consid- eration wholly for the assignor&#8217;s own benefit. See subsection (3)(c). The sell- ing agent who guarantees customers&#8217; accounts is commonly called a &#8220;del cre- dere factor&#8221;; an important inducement for the promise is the agent&#8217;s desire to advance his or her own interest. In ad- dition, the guaranty is likely to be part of a course of business rather than an isolated transaction.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">26. S, who is owed $1,000 by D, sells that claim against D to C, orally guaranteeing that D will pay the debt.

<p class="comment_indent1">27. S is engaged in selling goods for others on commission. To induce C to employ S, S orally guar- antees payment by those to whom S sells C&#8217;s goods. Later, S sells goods for C on credit to D. S&#8217;s promise is not within the Statute.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Comment to Subsection (3)(h):</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>r. Rationale.</i> In most cases, the promise described in this subsection will give the obligee as beneficiary a direct right against the secondary obli- gor without destroying its right against the principal obligor. The promise is not within the Statute of Frauds, how- ever, because the Statute is designed to require written evidence only in the case where the promise is made to the obligee. In contrast to the language of the Statute, the contract considered in subsection (3)(h) is one to answer for the default of the promisee, not for the default &#8220;of another.&#8221;</p>

<p class="chap-subtitle">(SELECTED SECTIONS)</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1. Restitution and Unjust Enrichment</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is subject to liability in restitution.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Unjust enrichment.</i> The law of restitution is predominantly the law of unjust enrichment, but &#8220;unjust enrichment&#8221; is a term of art. The sub- stantive part of the law of restitution is concerned with identifying those forms of enrichment that the law treats as &#8220;unjust&#8221; for purposes of imposing li- ability. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In reality, the law of restitution is very far from imposing liability for ev- ery instance of what might plausibly be called unjust enrichment. The law&#8217;s potential for intervention in transac- tions that might be challenged as ineq- uitable is narrower, more predictable, and more objectively determined than the unconstrained implications of the words &#8220;unjust enrichment.&#8221; Equity and good conscience might see an unjust en- richment in the performance of a valid but unequal bargain, or in the legally protected refusal to perform an equal one (as where the statute of limita- tions bars enforcement of a valid debt). Beyond these merely legal instances, moreover, &#8220;unjust enrichment&#8221; (in the natural and nontechnical sense of the words) might seem to be a pervasive fact of human experience&#8212;given any prior standard (such as equality or merit) by which people&#8217;s relative en- titlements might be measured.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The concern of restitution is not, in fact, with unjust enrichment in any such broad sense, but with a narrower set of circumstances giving rise to what might more appropriately be called unjustified enrichment. Compared to the open-ended implications of the term &#8220;unjust enrichment,&#8221; instances of unjustified enrichment are both pre- dictable and objectively determined, because the justification in question is not moral but legal. Unjustified en- richment is enrichment that lacks an adequate legal basis; it results from a transaction that the law treats as inef- fective to work a conclusive alteration in ownership rights. Broadly speaking, an ineffective transaction for these pur- poses is one that is nonconsensual. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Restitution and restoration.</i> Employed to denote liability based on unjust enrichment, the word &#8220;restitu- tion&#8221; is a term of art that has frequently proved confusing. &#8230; On the one hand, there are significant instances of liabil- ity based on unjust enrichment that do not involve the restoration of anything the claimant previously possessed. The most notable examples are cases in- volving the disgorgement of profits, or other benefits wrongfully obtained, in excess of the plaintiff&#8217;s loss. &#8230; On the other hand, there are numerous situa- tions in which a claimant&#8217;s undoubted right to the restitution (or restoration) of something does not depend on the unjust enrichment of the defendant. Thus if a transfer has been induced by misrepresentation, the transferor is entitled to rescission and restitution even if the transferee&#8212;having paid market value&#8212;cannot plausibly be said to have been enriched. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>e. Liability and remedy.</i> The fact that the word &#8220;restitution&#8221; is used to designate both liabilities and remedies in unjust enrichment leads to a series of common misunderstandings:&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Finally and most generally, the choice of the word &#8220;restitution&#8221; as the name for the subject has led to a com- mon misconception about what &#8220;the law of restitution&#8221; involves. This is the idea that restitution is essentially a remedy, and that the remedy of resti- tution is a device available in appropri- ate circumstances&#8212;as an alternative to damages&#8212;to enforce obligations de- rived from torts, contracts, and other topics of substantive law. &#8230; A liability in unjust enrichment (restitution) is enforced by restitution&#8217;s characteristic remedies, some (but not all) of which involve a literal restitution or giving back; and a claim in unjust enrichment (restitution) is subject to characteristic defenses. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Particular contexts invite further qualification. There are remedies for breach of contract that have frequent- ly been called &#8220;restitution&#8221; and have sometimes been explained in terms of unjust enrichment. This Restatement describes them as a part of contract law, not restitution, and it rejects the supposed connection with principles of unjust enrichment. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2. Limiting Principles</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The fact that a recipient has obtained a benefit without paying for it does not of itself establish that the recipient has been unjustly en- riched.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A valid contract defines the obligations of the parties as to mat- ters within its scope, displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) There is no liability in restitution for an unrequested benefit vol- untarily conferred, unless the circumstances of the transaction justify the claimant&#8217;s intervention in the absence of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Liability in restitution may not subject an innocent recipient to a forced exchange: in other words, an obligation to pay for a benefit that the recipient should have been free to refuse.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>c. Restitution subordinate to contract.</i> Judicial statements to the effect that &#8220;there can be no unjust en- richment in contract cases&#8221; can be mis- leading if taken casually. Restitution claims of great practical significance arise in a contractual context, but they occur at the margins, when a valuable performance has been rendered under a contract that is invalid, or subject to avoidance, or otherwise ineffective to regulate the parties&#8217; obligations. Ap- plied to any such circumstance, the statement that there can be no unjust enrichment in contract cases is plainly erroneous. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Properly interpreted, however, the same statement acknowledges an important limit to liability in unjust enrichment. Contract is superior to restitution as a means of regulating vol- untary transfers because it eliminates, or minimizes, the fundamental diffi- culty of valuation. Considerations of both justice and efficiency require that private transfers be made pursuant to contract whenever reasonably possible, and that the parties&#8217; own definition of their respective obligations&#8212;assum- ing the validity of their agreement by all pertinent tests&#8212;take precedence over the obligations that the law would impose in the absence of agreement. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Restitution is accordingly subordinate to contract as an organizing principle of private relationships, and the terms of an enforceable agreement normally displace any claim of unjust enrich- ment within their reach. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Benefits voluntarily conferred.</i> Instead of proposing a bargain, the res- titution claimant first confers a benefit, then seeks payment for its value. When this manner of proceeding is unaccept- able&#8212;as it usually is, if the claimant neglects an opportunity to contract&#8212;a claim based on unjust enrichment will be denied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The limitation of &#167; 2(3) is tradition- ally expressed by denying restitution to a claimant characterized as &#8220;officious,&#8221; an &#8220;intermeddler,&#8221; or a &#8220;volunteer.&#8221; This section states the same rule, sub- stituting a functional explanation for the familiar epithets. Because contract is strongly preferred over restitution as a basis for private obligations (see Comment c), restitution is not usually available to a claimant who has ne- glected a suitable opportunity to make a contract beforehand.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">There are cases in which a claim- ant may indeed recover compensation for unrequested benefits intentionally conferred&#8212;because the claimant&#8217;s in- tervention was justified under the cir- cumstances, and because a liability in restitution will not prejudice the recipi- ent. &#8230; Some are cases of emergency intervention, where the claimant in- tervenes to protect the interests of the recipient or of third persons. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 3. Wrongful Gain</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person is not permitted to profit by his own wrong.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> The present section marks one of the cornerstones of the law of restitution and unjust enrichment. The general principle it identifies is the one underlying the &#8220;disgorgement&#8221; remedies in restitu- tion, whereby a claimant potentially recovers more than a provable loss so that the defendant may be stripped of a wrongful gain. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Breach of an enforceable contract is not a source of unjust enrichment or wrongful gain, except in the special case of profitable and opportunistic breach (&#167; 39). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Recovery exceeding the claim- ant&#8217;s loss.</i> When the defendant has act- ed in conscious disregard of the claim- ant&#8217;s rights, the whole of the resulting gain is treated as unjust enrichment, even though the defendant&#8217;s gain may exceed both (i) the measurable injury to the claimant, and (ii) the reasonable value of a license authorizing the de- fendant&#8217;s conduct. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Restitution requires full disgorge- ment of profit by a conscious wrongdo- er, not just because of the moral judg- ment implicit in the rule of this section, but because any lesser liability would provide an inadequate incentive to lawful behavior. If A anticipates (accu- rately) that unauthorized interference with B&#8217;s entitlement may yield profits exceeding any damages B could prove, A has a dangerous incentive to take without asking&#8212;since the nonconsen- sual transaction promises to be more profitable than the forgone negotiation with B. The objective of that part of the law of restitution summarized by the rule of &#167; 3 is to frustrate any such cal- culation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">It follows that &#8220;inadequacy of a rem- edy at law&#8221; is not a requirement of a claim in restitution to disgorgement of wrongful gain. See &#167; 4(2). With the sole exception of &#167; 39&#8212;where inadequacy of contract damages is one of the conditions <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the restitution claim&#8212;it may be assumed in disgorgement cases that the injury to the claimant could be calculated with precision, and that damages would yield what is ordinarily regarded as full compensation for the harm. Yet a remedy limited to compen- sation does not vindicate the claimant&#8217;s right to insist that the transaction at is- sue&#8212;typically, some use by the defen- dant of the claimant&#8217;s property&#8212;take place by agreement with the claimant or not at all. If a conscious wrongdoer were able to make profitable, unau- thorized use of the claimant&#8217;s property, then pay only the objective value of the assets taken or the harm inflicted, the anomalous result would be to legiti- mate a kind of private eminent domain (in favor of a wrongdoer) and to sub- ject the claimant to a forced exchange. The law of restitution responds to this anomaly by making the wrongdoer li- able to disgorge profits wrongfully ob- tained, whenever such profits exceed recoverable damages. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 4. Restitution May Be Legal or Equitable or Both</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Liabilities and remedies within the law of restitution and unjust enrichment may have originated in law, in equity, or in a combination of the two.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A claimant otherwise entitled to a remedy for unjust enrichment, including a remedy originating in equity, need not demonstrate the inad- equacy of available remedies at law.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope.</i> The status of restitution as belonging to law or to equity has been ambiguous from the outset. The answer is that res- titution may be either or both. &#8230; The chameleon-like qualities of the term &#8220;restitution&#8221; permit its invocation in a variety of circumstances where the le- gal or equitable nature of a given rem- edy may not be apparent. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Persistent errors. &#8230;</i> The most widespread error is the assertion that a claim in restitution or unjust enrich- ment is by its nature equitable rather than legal. From this false premise a court may conclude, depending on the problem at hand, (i) that there is no right to jury trial of a particular is- sue; (ii) that the remedy in question is available where it might otherwise not be, because the relevant statute au- thorizes &#8220;equitable relief&#8221;; or (iii) that the claim in question may be dismissed because the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law. The first two conclu- sions may be justifiable for other rea- sons, but courts frequently reach them by mischaracterizing the law of resti- tution and unjust enrichment. &#8230; The third conclusion is simply wrong. See Comment <i>e</i>. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Adequacy of remedies at law.</i> Courts too often recite that one of the requirements of a claim based on un- just enrichment is the absence of an adequate legal remedy. This spurious proposition rests on an obvious fallacy, and it obscures what courts are actual- ly doing when they invoke it. See &#167; 4(2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The quickest demonstration of the fallacy involved in any such statement lies in the fact that a modern claim in restitution or unjust enrichment is so often the equivalent of a cause of action that was available at law. See Com- ments <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. Whenever the claim in unjust enrichment might be so charac- terized, the suggestion that the claim- ant must show the absence of a remedy at law is a palpable error. Courts that dismiss a claim of unjust enrichment based on a supposed &#8220;inadequacy&#8221; re- quirement are usually motivated by different concerns. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>The rule of &#167; 39, allowing disgorge- ment of profits realized by an oppor- tunistic breach of contract, inquires whether &#8220;the available damage rem- edy affords inadequate protection to the promisee&#8217;s contractual entitle- ment.&#8221; The particular concerns about adequacy of damages that explain this reference in the context of &#167; 39 recur nowhere else in this Restatement. Sec- tion 4(2) is stated in broad terms, with- out reference to &#167; 39, in order to convey as clearly as possible a general truth about the modern law of restitution and unjust enrichment; but &#167; 4(2) may be qualified by reference to &#167; 39(1), to the extent of any perceived inconsis- tency.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 5. Invalidating Mistake</b></p>

<p class="indent">(2) An invalidating mistake may be a misapprehension of either fact or law. There is invalidating mistake only when</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) but for the mistake the transaction in question would not have taken place; and</p>

<p class="indent1">(a) the risk is allocated to the claimant by agreement of the par- ties;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the claimant has consciously assumed the risk by deciding to act in the face of a recognized uncertainty; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) allocation to the claimant of the risk in question accords with the common understanding of the transaction concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A claimant does not bear the risk of a mistake merely because the mistake results from the claimant&#8217;s negligence.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>d. Mutual and unilateral mistake.</i> The distinction drawn in the law of contracts between mutual and unilateral mistake has no direct appli- cation to the law of restitution. When a plaintiff seeks restitution on account of mistake, the basis of liability is that the plaintiff has conferred an unintended benefit on the defendant; the uninten- tional character of the plaintiff&#8217;s act is independent of the defendant&#8217;s state of mind. In many restitution scenarios, moreover, the usual distinction be- tween unilateral and mutual mistake has no meaningful application. If an insurance company pays a beneficiary more than is due on a policy, and the beneficiary assumes that the payment received reflects the amount due, there is a sense in which the company has committed a unilateral mistake; there is another sense in which both parties share a common mistake as to their contractual position. In such a situa- tion, the attempted distinction between mutual and unilateral mistake is sim- ply beside the point. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Mistake of fact and mistake of law.</i> The present section rejects any distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law, adopting a conclu- sion reached long ago by the better- reasoned American decisions. The old <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law is repudiated because it has always been theoretically unsound; because the two types of mistake are frequently impossible to distinguish as a practical matter; and because the distinction, even when it is possible, has no relevance to the real analysis by which restitution is either granted or withheld. If a benefit is conferred by mistake, in circumstances that would otherwise support a claim in restitu- tion, neither the unjustified enrich- ment of the recipient nor the uninten- tional dispossession of the transferor is affected by a determination that the mistake was one of fact, one of law, or an amalgam of the two.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 10. Mistaken Improvements</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person who improves the real or personal property of another, acting by mistake, has a claim in restitution as necessary to prevent unjust enrich- ment.

<p class="noindent">then the person disadvantaged by the mistake has a claim in restitution as necessary to prevent the unjust enrichment of the other.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Relation to contract law.</i> The rule stated in this section overlaps with the doctrine of reformation in the law of contracts. A claim to reforma- tion of an executory contract might be brought within the terms of this sec- tion or of Restatement Second, Con- tracts &#167; 155. A uniform legal response is susceptible of consistent alternative explanations. The rationale in contract is that reformation gives effect to the real agreement of the parties; the ratio- nale in restitution is that reformation avoids the unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of the other.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Cases in which a contracting party seeks reformation of an executory con- tract, or of an instrument intended to embody the contractual obligation, might be explained equally well by ei- ther rationale. &#8230; Where property has already been transferred, the intuitive applicability of restitution and contract principles may diverge. Supposing that Blackacre has been conveyed under a mistaken deed description, the er- ror might result in the conveyance of either more or less land than the par- ties intended.&#8230; Either way, the party adversely affected might seek to reform the deed to conform to the agreement. In the case of underperformance, the immediate explanation of the grantee&#8217;s claim is in terms of contract; while in the case of overperformance, it is natu- ral for the mistaken grantor to focus on the grantee&#8217;s unjust enrichment. As in the case of mistaken payments, the focus <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of restitution for mistake in expres- sion is accordingly on overperformance rather than underperformance of a contractual obligation. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Mutual mistake.</i> A mistake in expression justifying relief under this section need not be &#8220;mutual,&#8221; nor does restitution depend on attributing the mistake to one person rather than another. The distinction between mu- tual and unilateral mistake is relevant to the contract problem of mistake in basic assumptions: it may accordingly be relevant to determining whether the parties (as the claimant necessar- ily alleges) formed a valid agreement with which the instrument in ques- tion is inconsistent. See Restatement Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 152&#8211;154. But the distinction is not helpful in analyzing the problem of mistake in expression, which can only arise against the back- ground of an otherwise valid agree- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The relevant mistake in such cases consists in the assumption that an in- strument correctly reflects the terms of the transaction as agreed, when in fact it does not. The circumstance that potentially justifies a claim in restitu- tion is the fact of a divergence between the terms of the instrument and the terms of the agreement, not the degree to which the parties may have turned their minds to the correctness of an instrument that they may or may not have prepared.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 13. Fraud and Misrepresentation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A transfer induced by fraud or material misrepresentation is sub- ject to rescission and restitution. The transferee is liable in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A transfer induced by fraud is void if the transferor had neither knowledge of, nor reasonable opportunity to learn, the character of the resulting transfer or its essential terms. Otherwise the transferee obtains voidable title.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Relation to contract law.</i> Because most transfers are made pur- suant to contract, rules that determine when such a transfer is subject to re- scission for fraudulent inducement necessarily coincide with rules that determine when the agreement itself is subject to avoidance. In the case of a contractual transfer, therefore, the consequences of fraudulent induce- ment may be simultaneously a part of contract law and of the law of res- titution. The rules here stated are in- tended to be fully consistent with the rules stated in Restatement Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 163&#8211;164, 372, and 376.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Where contract is concerned with the effectiveness of an agreement, the focus of restitution is on the ef- fectiveness of any resulting transfer. Although many issues of fraudulent inducement are simultaneously a ques- tion of contract and of restitution, the overlap between the subjects at this point is not complete. Avoidance of a wholly executory contract, whether the reason is fraud or something else, pres- ents no issue of restitution. Reversal of a completed exchange&#8212;whatever the basis of invalidity&#8212;is squarely within the province of restitution, while it is explained only awkwardly as a liability in contract. &#8230;</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. The problem of defini- tion.</i> Duress is frequently defined as a threat that overcomes a person&#8217;s free will or destroys a person&#8217;s &#8220;apparent consent.&#8221; Such a definition underscores the element that duress has in common with the other transactional defects addressed in this Topic, all of which make a transfer subject to rescission on grounds related to the validity of the transferor&#8217;s consent to the trans- action. As a standard for identifying the circumstances that constitute du- ress, however, a definition that relies on such measures as &#8220;overcoming the plaintiff&#8217;s will&#8221; or &#8220;leaving the plaintiff no reasonable alternative&#8221; is unsatis- factory for several reasons.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">As a purely descriptive matter, such formulas imply that the coercive pres- sure that constitutes duress must be overwhelming in degree, foreclosing any realistic choice between courses of action. Yet there are numerous circum- stances in which this is plainly not the case. Where coercion is independently tortious or illegal, the party seeking rescission need only establish that the coercion induced the transfer. The same standard is likely to apply when one party exerts pressure on another in bad faith, to extract a payment to which the first party has no colorable claim. In other cases, the conclusion that particular acts constitute duress is facilitated by analyzing the transaction in reverse. If unjust enrichment is easy to demonstrate and easy to measure (as where the claimant, in response to pressure, has overpaid a subsisting obligation), relatively modest pressure may be found to constitute duress if there is no other basis on which to or- der restitution. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A definition of duress that refers to overcoming the will or destroying the free agency of the victim necessarily implies either that there is a protected realm of uncoerced transactions, or that there is a threshold of resistance to pressure beyond which the victim, initially a free agent, no longer acts voluntarily. Neither implication is satisfactory, in view of the constraints to which every human choice is evi- dently subject; in particular, the sig- nificant coercion that may be lawfully exercised, in many circumstances, by a simple refusal to deal except on a party&#8217;s own terms. The conclusion of every bargain transaction might be said to involve overcoming the other party&#8217;s will, but few bargains will be condemned as involuntary. The fact that one party to a bargain has been obliged to choose between undesirable courses of action&#8212;even if it might be commonly said that he had &#8220;no reason- able alternative&#8221;&#8212;does not of itself make the bargain involuntary, so long as the other party&#8217;s threat or refusal is not regarded as wrongful.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Ultimately the idea of duress turns on a distinction, not between voluntary and coerced transactions, but between permissible and impermissible forms of coercion. A decision about what consti- tutes wrongful coercion performs the whole work of the definition. &#8230;</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> &#8230; When a transfer occurs as part of an exchange transaction, the rules of this section overlap substantially with the corre- sponding rules of contract law. See Re- statement Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 12&#8211;16. Both the test of incapacity, and the rules relating to such collateral mat- ters as disaffirmance and ratification, will be the same whether the case aris- es in restitution or in contract. But the characteristic applications of the two bodies of law are to different stages of the exchange transaction. Where lack of capacity is interposed as a defense to a party&#8217;s obligation under a wholly ex- ecutory contract, the case presents no issue of restitution. Conversely, where a party seeks to rescind an executed conveyance on the ground of incapac- ity, the enforceability of a purported contractual obligation is no longer di- rectly relevant. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Unjust enrichment as a result of rescission; good faith of transferee; notice of incapacity.</i> Like the other voidable transfers described in this Chapter, a transfer by a person who lacks legal capacity is not the product of the transferor&#8217;s unimpeded and le- gally effective consent. But the prob- lem of incapacity differs significantly from other transactional defects that share this common feature. Unlike fraud, duress, or undue influence, a finding of incapacity does not establish that the transferor has been the victim of a wrong. Unlike most transfers in- duced by mistake, a transfer by an in- capacitated person does not necessarily result in the unjust enrichment of the transferee. A transfer by an incapaci- tated person that is only voidable, not void, is not necessarily one that the law endeavors to suppress. Unlike most transfers subject to rescission, a trans- fer by an incapacitated person may be part of a transaction that is fair, rea- sonable, and ultimately beneficial to the transferor. In some circumstances, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>moreover, the effect of unwinding a transaction on the ground of incapacity would be to create unjust enrichment, rather than to reverse it. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">American law has traditionally shown greater indulgence toward mi- nority than toward other forms of in- capacity. In some jurisdictions it may still be the law that a minor may avoid an executed purchase and recover the price paid, without any obligation of counter-restitution beyond restoration of that part of the purchased property (if any) remaining in the minor&#8217;s pos- session. If by contrast an adult trans- feror lacks mental capacity&#8212;and such incapacity has not previously been adjudicated&#8212;the same transaction may not even be subject to rescission if the court finds that it was made on reasonable terms. The position of this Restatement is that the remedy of re- scission and restitution for incapac- ity (with the corollary obligation of counter-restitution by the claimant) is in principle the same, whatever the nature of the incapacity; that avoid- ance for incapacity is justified only to the extent that it serves a legitimate protective function; and that rescission must not result in unjust enrichment of the incapacitated claimant, at the expense of a person who has dealt with the claimant in good faith on reason- able terms. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Unjust enrichment under this section is measured by a reason- able charge for the services in question.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> The claim for emergency medical services rendered in the absence of contract is one of res- titution&#8217;s paradigms. Its significance lies not in its practical utility&#8212;a liti- gated claim under this section being a rarity&#8212;but in the clarity with which it reflects the general principles that justify a claim to compensation for nonbargained benefits voluntarily con- ferred. An emergency that threatens life or health offers the ultimate justifi- cation for conferring a benefit in the ab- sence of contract, if need be, asserting a claim for payment only after services have been rendered. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Professional services.</i> Emer- gency assistance rendered by a nonpro- fessional, however valuable, does not give rise to a claim in restitution under existing law. The result is that profes- sional providers of medical assistance are routinely given an enforceable claim to compensation; while the non- professional rescuer or good Samari- tan enjoys only such rewards as others may choose to bestow. See Illustration 7. The claim by a rescuer to recover for injuries suffered in the course of the rescue is a particularly compelling one, but such a recovery reflects compensa- tion and insurance principles, not prin- ciples of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Practical concerns are often ad- vanced to account for this difference in treatment. It is one thing to encourage professional intervention in emergen- cies, another to create financial incen- tives for would-be rescuers who might better remain on the sidelines. The problem of valuation is even more of an obstacle. Services of physicians, hospi- tals, and ambulance drivers are read- ily valued, while emergency rescue by <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a bystander is literally priceless. The fact that it is impossible to assign a val- ue to the rescue of human life explains why the rule of &#167; 20 is limited to pro- fessional services while the rule of &#167; 21 (protection of another&#8217;s property) is not. Unsolicited intervention to protect a person&#8217;s stray livestock or unmoored sailboat can be valued with relative ease, because it usually takes the form of services (by stables and dockyards) for which there is a market. The same difficulty explains the traditional re- fusal in admiralty to make any award in respect of &#8220;pure life salvage,&#8221; in cir- cumstances where salvage of property would be readily compensated.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The most important objection, in terms of its implications for broader restitution doctrine, is an even more basic one. The law does not require that every benefit be paid for. See &#167; 2(1). A heroic rescue may confer a benefit of inestimable value, but it is likely to be purely altruistic in origin. The imposi- tion of restitutionary liability in such circumstances&#8212;a principle that would become visible only when the claim was resisted&#8212;transforms an act of self- sacrifice into a contentious exchange of values. The law avoids these unedify- ing consequences by presuming that an emergency rescue is a gratuitous act. The heroic bystander receives noth- ing; the heroic professional receives a &#8220;reasonable and customary charge&#8221; for professional services, but nothing extra for heroism. See Illustration 2.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Doctor is summoned by Bystander to attend accident Vic- tim, who is lying unconscious. Doc- tor performs emergency surgery. Doctor&#8217;s reasonable and customary charge for the services rendered is $1000, which Victim refuses to pay. Doctor has a claim in restitution for $1000 against Victim.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Same facts as Illustration 1, except that the circumstances of the accident are such that both By- stander and Doctor act courageously and at great personal risk in coming to the aid of Victim. Their heroic in- tervention is not, in itself, a source of unjust enrichment. Bystander has no claim in restitution under this section, while Doctor&#8217;s entitle- ment to restitution is limited (as in Illustration 1) to his reasonable and customary charge of $1000 for pro- fessional services rendered. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A acts in an emergency to save the lives of B and C, sustain- ing crippling injuries as a result. In gratitude for A&#8217;s assistance, B promises to pay him a weekly pen- sion of $100. B&#8217;s promise is unsup- ported by consideration, but it may nevertheless be enforceable as a matter of contract law. (If such a promise is enforceable, B&#8217;s recogni- tion of the fact and value of the ben- efit conferred by A is a significant part of the rationale. See Restate- ment Second, Contracts &#167; 86, Com- ment d, Illustration 7.) Unlike B, C makes no promise of compensation and later rejects A&#8217;s suggestion that he is entitled to a reward. A is pos- sibly entitled to enforce B&#8217;s promise, but A has no claim in restitution against either B or C.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Measure of benefit.</i> Because the ultimate benefits of medical treat- ment are both contingent and difficult to value, marginal cases within the rule of &#167; 20 may pose problems in measur- ing enrichment. The practical answer to what is largely a classroom paradox is that services that are medically nec- essary are presumed to be beneficial, without regard to their ultimate out- come; moreover, that it is appropriate to value such services as if the recip- ient had requested them. The result, as in most cases of quantum meruit, is a liability measured by market value (&#167; 50(2)(b)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>d. Refusal.</i> There can be no claim under this section for services that a recipient having full legal capacity has attempted to refuse; or for which such a recipient has communicated to the provider, before the services were rendered, an unwillingness to pay. Capacity to consent is capacity to re- fuse. Conversely, the circumstances in which emergency medical care must be provided will sometimes justify a court in concluding that the recipient&#8217;s ap- parent refusal either to accept services or to pay for them is without legal ef- fect. See Illustration 9.</p>

The court determines that the services ren- dered by Hospital, in the face of Patient&#8217;s refusal to accept or pay for them, were necessary, appropriate, and beneficial to Patient; and that Patient&#8217;s mental impairment at the time of hospitalization deprived Pa- tient&#8217;s refusal of legal effect.

<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. Unrequested intervention.</i> The requirement that &#8220;the circum- stances justify the decision to intervene without request&#8221; is one that is common to all claims within &#167;&#167; 20&#8211;22. &#8230; As with claims based on the preservation of life and health under &#167; 20, the es- sence of the emergency that will justify a claimant&#8217;s unrequested intervention under &#167; 21 is the threat of imminent harm in circumstances where bargain- ing between the parties is impractica- ble. But whereas the obstacle to nego- tiation in &#167; 20 is the incapacity of the person benefited, in cases under &#167; 21 the usual difficulty is merely the inabil- ity to identify and communicate with the owner before steps must be taken to preserve the property in question. A strong case for relief under &#167; 21 is one in which it is safe to assume what the outcome of the forgone negotiation would have been. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) Absent liability in restitution, the claimant will not be com- pensated for the performance in question, and the defendant will re- tain the benefit of the claimant&#8217;s performance free of any liability to pay for it.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope.</i> Most transactions for which restitu- tion may be available by the rule of this section fall within one of two com- mon (though nonexclusive) patterns. In a first set of cases, A is a subcontrac- tor, B is a property owner, and C (now unavailable) is the general contractor with whom both parties have dealt. In a second, A has performed work ben- efiting B&#8217;s property under a contract with C, who is typically a tenant or a family member of B; C had an inter- est in seeing the work performed but no authority to bind B to pay for it. In either setting, the exit or insolvency of C leaves A without compensation for work that was performed as requested. If a further consequence of the inter- rupted transaction is that B stands to obtain a valuable benefit without pay- ing for it, the outcome may be one that the law will characterize as unjust en- richment. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Threshold limits to the claim.</i> &#8230; Restitution under this sec- tion is initially limited, in other words, to circumstances in which the imposi- tion of a new, noncontractual liabil- ity&#8230;will not contradict or undermine preexisting contractual dispositions regulating the three-cornered transac- tion that brings the parties together. But frequently it will not. A transac- tion in which A renders services to B without receiving the compensation promised by C is by definition one that has not gone as anticipated; the turn of events by which B stands to benefit at A&#8217;s expense often lies outside the range of contingencies that the parties have regulated by agreement. So long as contract is not a bar, the availability of restitution in this context depends above all on whether a remedy may be granted to A without subjecting B to a forced exchange. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Measure of recovery.</i> Cases governed by &#167; 25 often present a dis- parity between a recovery in restitution <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and the compensation to which the claimant would have been entitled un- der the defaulted contract. A success- ful claimant under this section recov- ers the amount of the benefit conferred on the defendant or the claimant&#8217;s cost of performance, whichever is less. Be- cause the claimant&#8217;s recovery is based on the defendant&#8217;s enrichment, and not on the claimant&#8217;s contract with an ab- sent third person, the claimant neces- sarily bears the risk that fluctuations in value, whatever their origin, will cause the value placed in the hands of the defendant to be less than the cost of performance. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 31. Unenforceability</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person who renders performance under an agreement that can- not be enforced against the recipient by reason of</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) indefiniteness, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the failure to satisfy an extrinsic requirement of enforceability such as the Statute of Frauds,</p>
<p class="noindent">has a claim in restitution against the recipient as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment. There is no unjust enrichment if the claimant re- ceives the counterperformance specified by the parties&#8217; unenforceable agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) There is no claim under this section if enforcement of the agree- ment is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, nor in any other case in which the allowance of restitution would defeat the policy of the law that makes the agreement unenforceable. Restitution is appropriate except to the extent that forfeiture is an intended or acceptable conse- quence of unenforceability.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; unenforceable agreements; relation to other sections.</i> &#8230; Section 31 describes a claim in restitution to recover ben- efits directly conferred as the perfor- mance required or invited by an un- enforceable agreement. For example, given an oral or indefinite contract for the sale of realty that the vendor sub- sequently repudiates, the purchaser&#8217;s claim to restitution of the price already paid is within the rule of this section. See Illustration 8. The related claim in respect of benefits indirectly conferred in the course of the interrupted trans- action&#8212;to employ the same example, the purchaser&#8217;s claim for the value of improvements made to the property before the vendor&#8217;s repudiation&#8212;is de- scribed by &#167; 27.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. The effect of performance.</i> Per- formance of a contract that is unen- forceable for the reasons identified in subsection (1) does not ordinarily result in forfeiture. Under many circumstanc- es, full or even partial performance of an agreement that would have been unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds so long as it remained execu- tory will render the agreement enforce- able by the performing party according to its terms. The scope of this &#8220;perfor- mance exception&#8221; is determined by the contract law of each jurisdiction, but it is a rule to which principles of unjust enrichment visibly contribute. Where the contract remains unenforceable notwithstanding the claimant&#8217;s perfor- mance, relief (if any) takes the form of the restitution claim described in this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Assuming that straightforward en- forcement of the contract is for some reason unavailable, the question arises whether the allowance of even par- tial relief on another theory will tend to undermine or stultify the rule by which enforcement is denied. The an- swer depends on the reasons for deny- ing enforcement of the contract. Rec- ognition of an alternative liability in restitution presents no conflict with competing legal objectives if the rea- son for unenforceability of the under- lying agreement is its indefiniteness. See Comment d. Where by contrast a statute bars enforcement of the agree- ment, courts will often inquire whether a recovery in restitution too closely re- sembles what the claimant would have obtained by enforcing the contract&#8212;thereby defeating the policy of the stat- ute in question. Statutes of limitations present the most obvious example. See subsection (2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">At the opposite extreme, if enforce- ment is barred by one of the common provisions of the Statute of Frauds&#8212;those derived more or less directly from the English act of 1677&#8212;it is univer- sally accepted that relief via restitu- tion is outside the bar of the statute. See Comment f. &#8230; The more difficult choices arise under modern regula- tory statutes that require a writing as a condition of enforcing particular agreements, such as contracts for real estate brokerage, home improvements, or contingent fees for legal services. In such cases a court may be obliged to de- termine whether the policy of a statute mandates forfeiture (with concomitant unjust enrichment) as a consequence of unenforceability.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Restitution and reliance.</i> This section describes a liability based on the unjust enrichment of the recipi- ent of the claimant&#8217;s contractual per- formance. The language of restitution is sometimes employed to veil what could be more candidly described as enforcement based on reliance. These are cases awarding compensation for losses incurred in performing (or pre- paring to perform) an unenforceable contract, notwithstanding the absence of benefit to the defendant as a result of the plaintiff&#8217;s expenditure. A straight- forward account of such outcomes de- scribes them in terms of promissory liability (circumventing unacceptable consequences of the Statute of Frauds), not as restitution based on unjust en- richment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Indefiniteness.</i> If a contract cannot be enforced because the terms specified by the parties fail to yield &#8220;a reasonably certain basis for giv- ing an appropriate remedy&#8221; via dam- ages or specific performance (U.C.C. &#167; 2&#8211;204(3)), a performing party is en- titled to restitution of a prepaid price, or to the value of a contractual perfor- mance for which the performer has not received the promised equivalent.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A transaction resulting in an in- definite contract must not be confused with a failed negotiation producing no contract at all. There is no claim un- der this section for a performance for which the defendant did not&#8212;at least implicitly&#8212;agree to pay, or for the val- ue of performance exceeding the price the defendant promised to pay for it.</p>

Husband and Wife agree that Wife will pay Husband&#8217;s law school tuition from her own earnings in exchange for Husband&#8217;s promise to bear the cost of Wife&#8217;s future edu- cation. Wife pays a total of $48,000 pursuant to this agreement. After Husband obtains a law degree, the parties agree to defer Wife&#8217;s further studies until Husband&#8217;s income is higher. The marriage is dissolved a few months thereafter. There is no marital property to be divided, and spousal support is not sought by either party; but Wife demands that Husband be required to bear her educational expenses.

Husband&#8217;s obligation to Wife is nevertheless unenforceable by reason of indefiniteness, because the parties reached no agreement about the nature, extent, or tim- ing of Wife&#8217;s future education. Wife has a claim against Husband under the rule of this section to recover $48,000. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Quantum meruit.</i> &#8230; In mod- ern practice, a claim styled &#8220;quantum meruit&#8221; typically seeks compensation for services rendered in the expecta- tion of payment, but in the absence of explicit agreement as to amount. Based on the circumstances of the transac- tion, it may be appropriate to find an implied promise by the defendant to compensate the plaintiff&#8212;usually at the customary wage or &#8220;going rate&#8221; for the work done. If so, the measure of the plaintiff&#8217;s contractual expectation is described by the words &#8220;quantum meruit&#8221; (or &#8220;as much as he is entitled to&#8221;), but the defendant&#8217;s obligation is fully explained as a matter of contract. In such a case it would be erroneous to associate &#8220;quantum meruit&#8221; with a li- ability in unjust enrichment, or to view the plaintiff&#8217;s action as one for restitu- tion rather than contract damages. See Illustration 6. Changing the facts only slightly yields a case in which it may be much harder to conclude that the de- fendant promised to pay a reasonable price for services received, although the law imposes the same obligation in the absence of agreement. See Illus- tration 7. Whether &#8220;quantum meruit&#8221; in the latter case should be explained in terms of implied contract or unjust enrichment (or both) may be difficult to say, but it is also unnecessary to decide: the justifications overlap, and they yield the same recovery in any event. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Measure of recovery.</i> Restitu- tion based on performance of an un- enforceable contract is likely to yield a smaller recovery than damages for breach. For reasons applicable to con- tract remedies generally, a recovery measured by benefit conferred is often less than the contractual expectation (which would give the claimant the full benefit of the bargain); it will often be less than damages measured by the claimant&#8217;s expenditures in reliance (which would reimburse expenditures not resulting in measurable benefit). See Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 344, Comment a. Restitution by the rule of this section is measured by the value of the claimant&#8217;s performance to the recipient, not by what was prom- ised in exchange, nor by what the claimant&#8217;s performance cost the claim- ant.

<p class="comment_indent">Nevertheless, the terms of the un- enforceable contract will influence and may even determine the measure of re- covery in restitution. The critical fact in this context is that the claimant&#8217;s per- formance was requested. (The fact that the parties&#8217; contract is unenforceable for reasons addressed by &#167; 31&#8212;unlike a contract vitiated by fraud or duress&#8212;carries no implication that the recipi- ent did not validly assent to the price term.) The value to the recipient of a requested performance&#8212;if performed as requested&#8212;is normally market val- ue when no price has been specified; otherwise, the lesser of market value and a price the recipient has expressed a willingness to pay. &#8230; Where there is a disparity between contract and mar- ket prices, restitution will be for the lesser amount&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">If the parties have specified a price for a performance that has no defini- tive market value&#8212;as in most cases of personal services&#8212;the value to the re- cipient of claimant&#8217;s performance may properly be determined, for restitution purposes, by what the recipient has of- fered to pay. The effect of restitution in <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>such a case may be indistinguishable from a partial enforcement, since it awards the contract price so far as the claimant has performed. Restitution remains easily distinguishable from contract damages, even if the price term is accepted as the measure of en- richment, because it affords no remedy in respect of the executory portion of the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the rare case in which the claim- ant might prove that a requested per- formance had a market value in excess of the promised compensation, recov- ery in restitution will be limited by the contract price. &#167; 50(2)(b). Had the contractual exchange been substan- tially performed on both sides&#8212;not- withstanding its unenforceability for one of the reasons stated in this sec- tion&#8212;there would have been no unjust enrichment of the defendant, because an agreed-upon exchange of values (unaffected by such defects as fraud and mistake) does not result in unjust enrichment. See &#167; 31(1). It follows that a liability in restitution under this sec- tion cannot exceed what would have been the defendant&#8217;s liability in con- tract, had the contract been enforce- able.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 32. Illegality</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A person who renders performance under an agreement that is illegal or otherwise unenforceable for reasons of public policy may obtain restitu- tion from the recipient in accordance with the following rules:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Restitution will be allowed, whether or not necessary to prevent unjust enrichment, if restitution is required by the policy of the underly- ing prohibition.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Restitution will also be allowed, as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment, if the allowance of restitution will not defeat or frustrate the policy of the underlying prohibition. There is no unjust enrichment if the claimant receives the counterperformance specified by the parties&#8217; unen- forceable agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Restitution will be denied, notwithstanding the enrichment of the defendant at the claimant&#8217;s expense, if a claim under subsection (2) is foreclosed by the claimant&#8217;s inequitable conduct.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 33. Incapacity of Recipient</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person who renders performance under an agreement that is unenforceable by reason of the other party&#8217;s legal incapacity has a claim in restitution against the recipient as necessary to prevent unjust enrich- ment. There is no unjust enrichment if the claimant receives the counter- performance specified by the parties&#8217; unenforceable agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Restitution under this section is available only to a person who has dealt with the recipient in good faith on reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Notwithstanding the unjust enrichment of the recipient, restitu- tion may be limited or denied if it would be inconsistent with the protec- tion that the doctrine of incapacity is intended to afford in the circum- stances of the case.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>c. Incapacity and unjust en- richment.</i> The rule stated in this sec- tion reflects two essential premises. The first is that the doctrine of inca- pacity, in all of its applications, serves primarily a protective function. In- fants, the mentally incompetent, and (in the case of municipal corporations) taxpayers are protected by the rules of incapacity against certain risks that persons of full legal capacity are free to assume. The protection so afforded is potentially costly. Legal incapacity is legal disability, and a person who lacks the capacity to undertake a legally binding obligation is foreclosed from participating in transactions that may be advantageous or even vitally nec- essary. Significant costs are imposed on the other party to the transaction, whenever a person who has dealt in good faith with an incapacitated coun- terparty is required to forfeit an other- wise valid legal entitlement. It follows that the contours of legal responsibil- ity in these cases are determined, not by measuring &#8220;capacity to contract&#8221; against some a priori standard, but by weighing at each point the value of the protection secured against the cost of securing it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The second premise underlying the rule of this section is that the dictates of equity and good conscience are in- dependent of the capacity to contract. Neither the restitution claim asserted by a given plaintiff, nor the wider legal interest in avoiding unjust enrichment, is in any way diminished because the benefit in question was conferred on a person, natural or artificial, lacking full legal capacity. The consequence, as expressed by the former Restatement of this subject, is that &#8220;Incapacity to enter into a contract or to incur liabil- ity in tort is not in itself a defense in an action for restitution.&#8221; Restatement of Restitution &#167; 139 (1937). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Liability in contract distin- guished from liability in restitution; measure of benefit.</i> Liability to honor a promise, on the one hand, and liability to restore or pay for a benefit received, on the other, are distinct grounds of le- gal responsibility that sometimes yield congruent results. Because the inca- pacitated person&#8217;s contractual under- taking is ex hypothesi invalid, such a party can be under no liability to accept or pay for a contractual performance that remains executory; nor will a li- ability in respect of benefits already re- ceived be imposed (or measured) by the terms of an invalid contract. &#8230; On the other hand, where the contract price of the benefit conferred is the same as the value of the benefit as determined by the court, the recipient&#8217;s liability in restitution&#8212;while distinguishable in concept&#8212;may be identical in extent to a liability on the invalid contract. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Because the value of a contrac- tual performance is not definitively established by a contract that is un- enforceable by reason of incapacity, the principal obstacle to a restitution claim under this section is the famil- iar problem of measuring benefit to the recipient. See &#167;&#167; 49&#8211;50. &#8230; Where the recipient retains undiminished the whole of the benefit conferred, there is usually no hardship in requiring the recipient to restore it&#8212;even if liability in restitution is indistinguishable in ef- fect from a liability on the unenforce- able contract. Where the extent of the recipient&#8217;s enrichment is debatable, or where the benefit conferred has been dissipated in whole or part, the pro- tective policy embodied in the recipi- ent&#8217;s incapacity to contract may justify a narrower measure of benefit than would be appropriate in the case of a recipient who lacked the same claim to special protection. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Liability under this section does not require that a benefit conferred on an incapacitated recipient consist of &#8220;nec- essaries.&#8221; The familiar notion that an <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>infant&#8217;s contract is enforceable if for necessaries&#8212;like the proposition of the older common law, that an infant&#8217;s contract was enforceable if and only if the contract was beneficial to the in- fant&#8212;expresses a restitution idea, im- perfectly assimilated to the language of contract: namely, that the liability of the infant in such cases is not really in contract (on the promise) but rather in unjust enrichment (for benefits re- ceived). There is liability for necessar- ies, in other words, because necessaries are presumptively beneficial. Accept- ing the premise, however, that liability in such cases is based not on contract but on unjust enrichment&#8212;so that there is no liability in excess of benefit received&#8212;the classification of certain benefits as &#8220;necessaries&#8221; is rendered superfluous, because it is subsumed within the basic inquiry into measure of enrichment.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 34. Mistake or Supervening Change of Circumstances</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person who renders performance under a contract that is sub- ject to avoidance by reason of mistake or supervening change of circum- stances has a claim in restitution to recover the performance or its value, as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment. If the case is one in which the requirements of &#167; 54 can be met, the remedy of rescission and restitution permits the reversal of the transaction without the need to demonstrate unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) For purposes of subsection (1):</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the value of a nonreturnable contractual performance is mea- sured by reference to the recipient&#8217;s contractual expectations; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the recipient&#8217;s liability in restitution may be reduced to allow for loss incurred in reliance on the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to Restatement Second, Con- tracts.</i> Contract law&#8212;applying the re- lated tests of mistake, impossibility, impracticability, and frustration&#8212;per- mits the avoidance of an obligation on which the parties ostensibly agreed but for which (as a result of their failure to apprehend or anticipate relevant cir- cumstances) they did not actually bar- gain. To the extent the obligation in question remains executory, the issue between the parties is limited to the enforceability of the challenged agree- ment. Such a question is purely a mat- ter of contract law. If the obligation has been partially or wholly performed, the same challenge to the transaction pres- ents what is simultaneously a question of contract and a question of restitu- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Claims within the rule of this sec- tion take two principal forms. In the case of a partially completed exchange, the party disadvantaged by the se- quence of performance stands in the same position as one who has rendered performance under an agreement that is subsequently revealed to be unenforceable for some other reason. Compare &#167;&#167; 31&#8211;33. The claimant has conferred a benefit at the request of the defendant, without obtaining the promised exchange; enforcement of the contract is unavailable, in this case be- cause the parties&#8217; agreement has been set aside on the ground of mistake. The claimant&#8217;s recourse is a claim in res- titution measured by the defendant&#8217;s net enrichment. &#8230; The second type <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of restitution claim seeks to unwind a completed transaction. Although the contract has been fully performed ac- cording to its terms, the disadvantaged party asserts that the resulting ex- change, in its actual realization, finds no adequate basis in contract because it is not what the parties had in mind. See Comments e and f. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Extent of performance.</i> Con- fronted with a disparity between an- ticipation and realization that inter- rupts a contractual performance&#8212;or that leads one party to argue that a completed performance should be unwound&#8212;a court will ordinarily ask whether the risks associated with the disparity in question have been allo- cated by the parties, expressly or by implication; and whether the contrac- tual exchange of values (executory, completed, or somewhere in between) is fairly comprehended within the par- ties&#8217; agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The relevant aspect of contract doc- trine (frequently called &#8220;mistake in ba- sic assumptions&#8221;) and the associated analytical method (usually explained in terms of risk allocation) are ac- cordingly the same, whether they are deployed defensively (to resist enforce- ment of the contract) or affirmatively (to unwind a completed transaction). Yet the contract defense and the af- firmative restitution claim are not available on equal terms. Given an equivalent disparity between anticipa- tion and realization, in every setting where the facts permit the comparison, a court will more readily deny enforce- ment to an executory agreement than order restitution of the same values once they have been exchanged. To put the matter another way: across a broad range of cases involving &#8220;mistake in ba- sic assumptions,&#8221; the predictable out- come is the denial of relief to the mov- ing party. See Illustrations 1&#8211;2.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Rose 2d of Aberlone, a purebred cow belonging to Farmer, fails to breed in season; on exami- nation by a veterinarian she is de- termined to be barren. Farmer sells Rose to Breeder for $300, a price based on her value as beef. Before the day fixed for delivery and pay- ment, Rose is discovered to be with calf; her value as a breeding animal is not less than $3000. Farmer re- pudiates the sale, and Breeder sues for specific performance or dam- ages. Breeder&#8217;s claim is in contract, not restitution; Farmer&#8217;s defense asserts a theory of mistake as the ground for avoidance. Breeder&#8217;s claim will predictably be denied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Same facts as Illustration 1, except that Rose&#8217;s fertility is dis- covered after Rose has been deliv- ered and paid for. Farmer brings suit to rescind the completed ex- change. The plaintiff&#8217;s claim is now in restitution, not contract, though it alleges the identical mistake as the ground for avoidance. Farmer&#8217;s claim will predictably be denied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The paradoxical conclusion&#8212;that the legal validity of a contractual ex- change may depend on the extent to which it has been performed&#8212;is part- ly explained by reference to the ex- tra costs of unwinding any completed transaction. And yet courts will indeed unwind completed transactions in other circumstances, where the alter- native to intervention is an exchange that a court views as extracontractu- al&#8212;meaning that the transaction, as revealed in performance, is outside the scope of the parties&#8217; agreement. &#8230; Evi- dently courts will intervene to allocate or reassign some unanticipated risks more readily than others. The task of drawing the necessary distinctions is a notoriously difficult problem of con- tract law that is outside the scope of this Restatement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>e. Unwinding a completed trans- action.</i> Rescission and restitution, even of a fully completed exchange, is a ba- sic remedial response if the underlying contract has been induced by fraud. Courts are much less likely to unwind an executed contract as a remedy for mistake. The question, simply put, is whether the exchange that has taken place is sufficiently grounded in the parties&#8217; bargain to be confirmed as le- gally effective. In addressing this ques- tion, many risks of variation that were not the subject of explicit negotiation will be found to have been allocated by implication, or will be assigned as a matter of law, to the disadvantaged party. See &#167; 5, Comment b.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">So long as an agreement has been freely negotiated&#8230; contract law gen- erally assumes that buyers bear the risk of having paid too much, while sellers bear the risk of having accept- ed too little. Barriers to relief become nearly insuperable once the exchange has been fully performed. Compare Il- lustrations 1 and 2. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Cases that do allow rescission and restitution on grounds of mistake most often involve a claimant who has paid for something that (unknown to the parties) never existed, no longer exists, or does not belong to the seller. &#8230; An occasional case presents the converse situation, in which the claimant has surrendered something that proves to be significantly more valuable than the parties supposed. &#8230; Either version yields a contract case that is ostensi- bly concerned with &#8220;mutual mistake in formation,&#8221; but that closely resembles a restitution case of &#8220;mistake in perfor- mance&#8221;&#8212;yielding a relatively straight- forward claim based on mistaken pay- ment or mistake in conferring benefits other than money.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The suggested hypothesis is thus that a court will occasionally order rescission and restitution as a rem- edy for mistake as to value, but only in those cases where the effect of the remedy closely resembles restitution of a mistaken performance&#8212;typically an overpayment, or a payment where no payment was actually due. Where by contrast the effect of rescission and restitution would be the repricing or reallocation of risks over which the parties have explicitly or implicitly bargained&#8212;however mistakenly&#8212;the remedy will be denied. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Restitution in this context does not depend on whether the mistake in ques- tion is &#8220;mutual&#8221; or &#8220;unilateral.&#8221; An ex- change that corresponds to the under- standing of one party but not the other can claim no more than a tenuous basis in the parties&#8217; agreement. The distinc- tion is of practical significance, howev- er, because a party who is not himself mistaken, and who is unaware that the other is acting under a mistake, will be protected in his reliance on the other&#8217;s expressions of assent. The consequence is that restitution for unilateral mis- take in basic assumptions will be avail- able only when the defendant had rea- son to know of the claimant&#8217;s mistake or when the defendant has taken no action in reliance on the parties&#8217; ap- parent bargain. Conversely, knowledge by one party of the other&#8217;s mistake as to value is not grounds for avoidance when the mistaken party bears the risk of the mistake in question. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 35. Performance of Disputed Obligation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If one party to a contract demands from the other a performance that is not in fact due by the terms of their agreement, under circum- stances making it reasonable to accede to the demand rather than to in- sist on an immediate test of the disputed obligation, the party on whom the demand is made may render such performance under protest or with <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>reservation of rights, preserving a claim in restitution to recover the val- ue of the benefit conferred in excess of the recipient&#8217;s contractual entitle- ment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The claim described in subsection (1) is available only to a party acting in good faith and in the reasonable protection of its own inter- ests. It is not available where there has been an accord and satisfaction, or where a performance with reservation of rights is inadequate to dis- charge the claimant&#8217;s obligation to the recipient.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 36. Restitution to a Party in Default</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A performing party whose material breach prevents a recovery on the contract has a claim in restitution against the recipient of perfor- mance, as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Enrichment from receipt of an incomplete or defective contractual performance is measured by comparison to the recipient&#8217;s position had the contract been fully performed. The claimant has the burden of estab- lishing the fact and amount of any net benefit conferred.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A claim under this section may be displaced by a valid agreement of the parties establishing their rights and remedies in the event of de- fault.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) If the claimant&#8217;s default involves fraud or other inequitable con- duct, restitution may on that account be denied.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to contract law</i>&#8230; [T]his sec- tion applies to cases in which (i) the performing party has no enforceable rights under the contract, whether by a rule of substantial performance, of severability, or otherwise; and (ii) the claim based on unjust enrichment is not displaced by a valid contractual provision imposing forfeiture or liqui- dated damages. Where a remedy to the party in default is neither conferred nor foreclosed by valid terms of the agree- ment, restitution authorizes a claim as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment. The principal task confronting the res- titution claimant is to establish that an incomplete or defective performance has in fact conferred a net benefit on the recipient, taking into account the various costs to which the defendant has been subjected in the wake of the claimant&#8217;s default. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Willful or deliberate default.</i> Courts in many jurisdictions continue to state that restitution is unavailable to a party whose contractual default is willful or deliberate. The quality of the breach in a particular case manifestly determines the claimant&#8217;s equitable posture in seeking restitution. The claimant&#8217;s conduct may be culpable or excusable; it may reflect opportun- ism or merely inadequate resources; it may manifest a conscious disregard of the defendant&#8217;s legal entitlement, on the one hand, or simple inadvertence, on the other. The court&#8217;s sense of the claimant&#8217;s relative equitable position will in many instances determine the success or failure of the claim.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">It is potentially misleading, how- ever, to describe willful or deliberate default as an absolute bar to the claim under this section. In the large and significant class of cases where the claimant&#8217;s defaulted obligation is to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>pay money, the breach of contract&#8212;the failure to pay a debt when due&#8212;is most often the result of a conscious election. Even a debtor who faces financial hard- ship normally has a choice to pay one creditor rather than another. It can be difficult to explain why breach in such instances should not be qualified as &#8220;willful&#8221; or &#8220;deliberate&#8221;; yet the same instances include some of the foremost illustrations of cases in which modern American law authorizes restitution to the party in default. See Comment d.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Although restitution is undeniably available in some cases of deliberate default, there remain many circum- stances in which the quality of the claimant&#8217;s breach will effectively bar the claim. The significance of &#8220;deliber- ateness&#8221; in this context lies in the ex- traordinary costs that will frequently be imposed by an election to discontin- ue a contractual performance already under way. Assuming a simple choice between performance and breach, the election to perform yields a straight- forward claim to the price specified by contract, securing contractual expecta- tions on both sides; while the election to default, and then to pursue a claim in restitution, draws the litigants and the court into a complex, extracontrac- tual evaluation of both benefit con- ferred and injury inflicted. The reme- dial inefficiency of the latter course is obvious, as is the risk that the innocent party will incur substantial uncom- pensated costs in consequence of the claimant&#8217;s election to breach. Judicial awareness of these factors accounts for the traditional rule that denies resti- tution whenever default is &#8220;willful or deliberate.&#8221; The omission of this con- dition from &#167; 36 must not be taken to imply that such factors have somehow become irrelevant. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Amount of recovery; burden of proof.</i> There is a claim in restitu- tion in respect of defaulted contractual performance only if and to the extent the claimant can prove that the benefit thereby conferred, net of losses attrib- utable to claimant&#8217;s default, results in the enrichment of the defendant. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Net enrichment is measured by ref- erence to the defendant&#8217;s contractual expectation. &#8230; The uniform test is to compare the defendant&#8217;s actual po- sition with the position the defendant would have occupied in the absence of breach. Given the difficulty in many circumstances of quantifying the inju- ry to the defendant from the claimant&#8217;s breach, the appropriate reduction may be liberally estimated. The object is to insure that the nonbreaching defen- dant will under no circumstance be left with a net loss from the transaction &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When the claimant seeks restitu- tion of the value of a nonreturnable performance, it may be necessary to choose between alternative measures of the benefit conferred. To the extent the claimant&#8217;s breach of contract in- cludes an element of fault, the equi- ties of the claim under &#167; 36 will tend to favor the application of the most restrictive test among those proposed by &#167; 49(3). This will ordinarily mean either (i) a ratable portion of the con- tract price, (ii) the market value of the benefit conferred, or (iii) the resulting addition to the defendant&#8217;s wealth, whichever is least. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Benefit conferred in goods or services</i>&#8230; A party in default under a contract to render personal services is ordinarily entitled to restitution by the rule of this section unless the nature of the default indicates fraud or ineq- uitable conduct. Even if the claimant has been guilty of conscious wrongdo- ing, the tendency of more recent de- cisions&#8212;where the facts permit&#8212;is to distinguish periods of faithful and disloyal service, awarding the value of services performed during the former but not the latter. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Claims in respect of legal services make up an important subcategory of cases within this section. &#8230; Within the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>terms of the present section, the ques- tion is whether the lawyer&#8217;s breach of duty involves fraud or inequitable con- duct: professional and fiduciary obliga- tions to the client increase the likeli- hood that a lawyer&#8217;s default may be of this character. Absent such a bar, even a lawyer discharged for cause may re- cover for the value of services rendered, provided that those services have con- ferred a net benefit on the client. By contrast, restitution will uniformly be denied to a lawyer who abandons a rep- resentation without justification. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a plaintiff who is entitled to a remedy for the defendant&#8217;s material breach or repudiation may choose rescission as an alternative to enforcement if the further requirements of &#167; 54 can be met.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Rescission as a remedy for breach of contract is not available against a defendant whose defaulted obligation is exclusively an obliga- tion to pay money.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> This section describes an alternative remedy for breach of contract that is sometimes called &#8220;restitution&#8221; but is more eas- ily recognized under the name &#8220;rescis- sion.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Rescission is one of the principal asset-based remedies in restitution, and breach of contract is only one of the problems to which it is a possible response. (In addition to its role as a remedy for material breach, rescission may be an obvious choice when there has been performance under a contract that is subject to avoidance for fraud, mistake, or similar grounds of invalid- ity.) Section 54 presents a general ac- count of the remedy called &#8220;rescission and restitution,&#8221; setting forth the ob- jectives, requirements, and operation of the remedy in the various settings where it may be employed. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Rescission in practice.</i> In the- ory, and sometimes in practice, rescis- sion pursuant to &#167; 37 permits a plaintiff who has paid in advance for a defaulted performance to recover an amount ex- ceeding compensatory damages. Such outcomes are rare, because a prepaid seller will almost never forfeit a profit that might be earned, at the seller&#8217;s option, by performing the contract or simply by releasing the buyer. &#8230; The simple rule is that a plaintiff who seeks only the return of a prepaid price will not (for reasons of both fairness and economy) be put to the burden of proving damages from the defendant&#8217;s breach. There is no comparable wind- fall to the plaintiff if the sequence of performance is reversed, because re- scission is not available as a remedy for payment default. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Ordinarily, the reason to elect re- scission is the relative certainty of the remedy compared with the difficulty (and expense) of proving damages or obtaining specific performance. Plain- tiffs in these cases forgo the benefit of a (presumably advantageous) bargain because the anticipated recovery from rescission, net of the cost of obtaining it, is higher. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. The quality of defendant&#8217;s breach.</i> Any breach of contract that results in quantifiable injury gives the plaintiff a remedy in damages, but the remedy of rescission is available only in cases of significant default. Short of a repudiation, the defendant&#8217;s breach must be &#8220;material,&#8221; &#8220;substantial,&#8221; &#8220;es- sential,&#8221; or &#8220;vital&#8221;; it must &#8220;go to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>root&#8221; of the defendant&#8217;s obligation, or be &#8220;tantamount to a repudiation.&#8221; To replace this familiar catalogue of adjec- tives, both Restatements of Contracts employ the expression &#8220;total breach.&#8221; See Restatement of Contracts &#167; 313(1) (1932); Restatement Second, Con- tracts &#167;&#167; 236(1), 243, 253, &amp; 373. The reformed terminology is not entirely successful, because the expression &#8220;to- tal breach&#8221; is easily misconstrued. In particular, it is not a requirement of &#8220;total breach&#8221; by the Restatement defi- nition that the defendant have failed to render any part of the promised contractual performance. The present Restatement employs the term &#8220;ma- terial breach&#8221; to designate what both Restatements of Contracts call &#8220;total breach,&#8221; only because its meaning is more readily understood.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Of course the real test is not verbal but functional. The effect of rescission, at a minimum, is to deprive the defen- dant of the benefit of the bargain. To the extent of the defendant&#8217;s expense in the course of partial performance, rescission imposes on the defendant an additional loss. If the defendant repudi- ates the contract, or commits a breach by nonperformance of equivalent gravi- ty, these consequences are presumably justifiable. On the other hand, if the defendant&#8217;s breach is relatively minor in the context of the overall undertak- ing, and if the injury to the plaintiff is appropriately remedied by an award of damages, the same consequences of rescission might impose an unac- ceptable and punitive forfeiture. If the plaintiff (having suffered a loss of $5) could threaten to impose a loss of $100 on the defendant by seeking rescission instead of $5 damages, the availability of rescission would become a source of costly opportunism. The requirement of repudiation or material breach is a safeguard against this misuse of a rem- edy that is intended as a shield and not a sword. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(1) As an alternative to damages based on the expectation interest (Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 347), a plaintiff who is entitled to a remedy for material breach or repudiation may recover damages mea- sured by the cost or value of the plaintiff&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p class="indent1">(a) uncompensated expenditures made in reasonable reliance on the contract, including expenditures made in preparation for perfor- mance or in performance, less any loss the defendant can prove with reasonable certainty the plaintiff would have suffered had the contract been performed (Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 349); or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the market value of the plaintiff&#8217;s uncompensated contractual performance, not exceeding the price of such performance as deter- mined by reference to the parties&#8217; agreement.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to Restatement Second, Contracts.</i> The remedy described in the present section is one of the two prin- cipal devices sometimes referred to as &#8220;restitution for breach of contract,&#8221; the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>other being rescission (&#167; 37). Though called &#8220;restitution&#8221; it is simply an award of damages. It is distinguished from ordinary contract damages, mea- sured by the plaintiff&#8217;s expectation interest, because it permits a plaintiff who cannot prove expectation to recov- er damages calculated on an alterna- tive basis.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Damages of this kind have tradi- tionally been associated with the idea of &#8220;restitution&#8221; because they tend to &#8220;restore&#8221;: they restore the plaintiff to the precontractual position, or they restore to the plaintiff either the cost or the value of the plaintiff&#8217;s uncom- pensated performance. Cost of perfor- mance is the measure more frequently employed: the plaintiff recovers dam- ages measured by unreimbursed ex- penditure in reliance on the contract, subject to provable expectation as a cap. Less often, the basis of the perfor- mance-based damage calculation is the value of the plaintiff&#8217;s uncompensated performance, not exceeding the price of such performance at the contract rate. Damages measured by expenditure are commonly called &#8220;reliance damages.&#8221; Damages measured by the value of per- formance go by various names, includ- ing both &#8220;restitution&#8221; and &#8220;reliance&#8221; as well as &#8220;quantum meruit.&#8221; Conceptual and terminological confusion has ob- scured the fact that the measures of cost and value are&#8212;for the most part&#8212;parallel versions of a single alternative damage remedy. See Comment b.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Either approach to damages under this section yields a second-best, &#8220;fall- back&#8221; alternative to damages measured by expectancy. A plaintiff who can prove expectation damages will seek to recover them, because they yield the benefit of a favorable bargain and the highest recovery. The rule of the pres- ent section offers a remedial alterna- tive in cases where the plaintiff cannot establish expectation damages&#8212;either because of difficulties of proof, or be- cause contractual expectancy is prov- able but negative. Performance-based damages yield a partial recovery in such cases, though they do not permit a complete escape from an unfavorable bargain: a plaintiff who was obligated to perform at a loss may not character- ize losses from performance as dam- ages from breach. (A plaintiff whose performance of a losing contract is interrupted by the defendant&#8217;s breach does avoid the further losses that the plaintiff would have incurred in com- pleting performance. See Comment d.) By contrast, a plaintiff who is entitled to rescission as a remedy for material breach will sometimes escape entirely the consequences of an unfavorable bargain.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The usual application of the rule of &#167; 38, therefore, is either to a case in which the plaintiff&#8217;s contractual ex- pectation cannot be established at all, or to a case in which&#8212;although the plaintiff&#8217;s expectancy cannot be known with certainty&#8212;it can be shown to lie somewhere within an upper limit. In either case, an alternative damage calculation by the rule of &#167; 38 protects the plaintiff&#8217;s expectancy so far as the evidence permits, based on a rebutta- ble presumption that the plaintiff was neither performing at a loss nor selling at less than market value. More spe- cifically, the presumption is that the plaintiff&#8217;s earnings from performance would have been at least sufficient to defray the plaintiff&#8217;s reliance expen- ditures; alternatively, that the plain- tiff&#8217;s unknown expectancy would have been at least equal to the market value of the plaintiff&#8217;s performance. Either presumption may be rebutted by the defendant, on proof that the plaintiff&#8217;s contractual expectancy was something less than the damages sought by this alternative measure.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Frequently&#8212;most obviously, where the remedy for the defendant&#8217;s breach is the recovery of money paid to the defendant&#8212;there is no meaningful distinction between the cost and value <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the plaintiff&#8217;s performance. In other cases, the plaintiff&#8217;s choice between cost and value as the basis of the al- ternative damage calculation (that is, between subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b)) is determined by which yields the larg- er recovery&#8212;or merely by which is the more easily measured. See Comment b.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This account of performance-based damages differs substantially from the description of the same remedies in the first and second Restatements of Con- tracts, but the present revision&#8212;out- side one narrow field&#8212;will not alter the results of cases. Its purpose is rather to provide a simplified and rationalized explanation of some straightforward contract remedies that have become needlessly difficult to describe. Be- cause this Restatement recognizes the terms of the contract as a limit on any damage recovery, it modifies the prior treatment of those few cases&#8212;promi- nent in theory, but rare in practice&#8212;in which a plaintiff seeks &#8220;restitution&#8221; to escape the consequences of an unfavor- able bargain. See Comment c. Apart from its treatment of &#8220;losing contracts,&#8221; however, the simpler rule of the pres- ent section yields the same outcomes as Restatement Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 349 and 373.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">As the Illustrations to this section will make clear, damages by the alter- native measures here described are available when the effect of the defen- dant&#8217;s breach or repudiation is to dis- charge the plaintiff&#8217;s remaining duties of performance&#8212;making the award of damages a full reckoning of the par- ties&#8217; contractual obligations. Plaintiff&#8217;s entitlement in such circumstances is to &#8220;damages for total breach&#8221; (Restate- ment Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 236(1), 243, 253), as opposed to compensation for some limited respect in which the defen- dant&#8217;s performance has been deficient. Because the expression &#8220;total breach&#8221; is frequently misunderstood, this Re- statement refers instead to &#8220;damages for material breach or repudiation.&#8221; See &#167; 37, Comment c. But there is no intention to disturb the distinction be- tween total and partial breach drawn by the prior Restatement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Cost or value; &#8220;reliance dam- ages&#8221;; special damages.</i> A plaintiff who cannot prove expectation dam- ages&#8212;because a benefit of the bargain cannot be established with sufficient certainty&#8212;may prove and recover, as an alternative measure of damages, either the cost or the value of the plain- tiff&#8217;s uncompensated performance. See Comment a. Damages so measured are a second-best remedy. They omit any element of profit: a plaintiff who could show lost profit from performance would prove and recover ordinary ex- pectation damages. A recovery based on cost will be reduced (or eliminated altogether) if the defendant can prove that the plaintiff would have suffered a loss had the contract been performed. A recovery based on value will be limited to the contract rate for the performance in question&#8212;when such a rate may be determined&#8212;even if this is insufficient to allow the plaintiff to recoup the cost of performance. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A plaintiff with a choice will ordi- narily base the alternative damage claim on reliance expenditures, rather than on the value of performance. This is because expenditures are generally easier to prove, and because expen- diture in the course of partial perfor- mance (often involving preparations for performance, or the costs of &#8220;incidental reliance&#8221;) typically exceeds the value of the performance actually rendered. The distinction between cost and value is ignored in many cases, where the two characterizations of the alterna- tive damage claim are effectively inter- changeable. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Less familiar than cases of &#8220;reli- ance damages,&#8221; only because they are far less numerous, are cases in which it is easier to establish the market value of a contractual performance than to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>measure the plaintiff&#8217;s expenditures in performance. Section 38(2)(b) allows a plaintiff to recover damages equal to that market value, so long as the parties&#8217; agreement does not establish a lower price for the performance in question. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Contract terms respected.</i> Per- formance-based damages by the rule of this section are a substitute for dam- ages based on expectancy, and they are limited by expectancy at most points where expectancy can be established. Breach of contract does not make the defendant a guarantor of the profit- ability of the plaintiff&#8217;s bargain; dam- ages compensate loss attributable to the breach, not loss attributable to an unfavorable exchange. Performance- based damages, like expectation dam- ages, respect the price terms and the risk allocations established by the par- ties&#8217; agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Damages measured by the cost of the plaintiff&#8217;s performance are re- duced to the extent the defendant can prove that the plaintiff would have suffered a loss had the contract been performed. In this regard the rule of &#167; 38(2)(a) is identical to Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 349. The fact that &#8220;reliance damages&#8221; are reduced by an- ticipated losses, while a recovery based on rescission is not, may determine the plaintiff&#8217;s choice between the two. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When performance-based damages are measured by the value of a perfor- mance rather than its cost, the damage calculation is also limited by the price term of the contract, but the limit is im- posed differently. In determining dam- ages by the rule of &#167; 38(2)(b), the value of a plaintiff&#8217;s performance may not ex- ceed the contract rate (if there is one) fixed by the parties&#8217; agreement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The plaintiff who seeks to recover unreimbursed expenditures is required to deduct any loss that would have been incurred upon full performance of the contract. By contrast, the plaintiff who seeks the value of a partial per- formance is limited to recovery at the contract rate for what has been done, but is not charged with the further loss that would have been incurred had per- formance been completed. The result is that damages under &#167; 38(2)(a) are lim- ited by contractual expectancy, while damages under &#167; 38(2)(b) are limited by the contract rate but not necessarily by expectancy. See Comment d. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Losing contracts.</i> When a party who cannot prove expectation damages seeks instead to recover un- reimbursed expenditures in reliance on the contract, it is an accepted rule that the award of damages may not shift to the defendant losses that the plaintiff would have realized on full performance. When the plaintiff who has been performing at a loss seeks damages measured by the value of performance, some authorities allow a recovery &#8220;off the contract,&#8221; unlimited by the contract price; but this Restate- ment rejects that outcome. By capping the damage calculation at the contract rate (where such a rate may be deter- mined), &#167; 38(2)(b) prevents these plain- tiffs as well from electing performance- based damages as a means of escape from an unfavorable bargain.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The contrary rule, allowing dam- ages measured by the value of perfor- mance unlimited by the contract price, permits the injured party to reallocate or revalue risks that it is the function of contract to price and to assign. Such an outcome is contrary to fundamental objectives of contract law and inconsis- tent with the other remedies for breach of contract, all of which take the par- ties&#8217; agreement as the benchmark by which the plaintiff&#8217;s remedies are mea- sured.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A result that is plainly anomalous from a contract standpoint therefore came to be explained as a liability in unjust enrichment rather than con- tract. By the principles of this Restatement, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>however, performance of a valid and enforceable contract does not re- sult in the unjust enrichment of the re- cipient. The argument to the contrary asserts that the defendant is unjustly enriched if he retains the benefit of a contract (goods or services on below- market terms) that he has failed to per- form on his side. But the benefit to the defendant in such a case is the result of the contract, not of the breach. As- suming for the sake of argument that a breach of contract might be seen as a legal wrong, comparable to a tort&#8212;though the law does not generally so regard it&#8230;&#8212;the result of defendant&#8217;s wrongdoing in such a case is not to ben- efit the defendant at the plaintiff&#8217;s ex- pense, but to benefit the plaintiff at the defendant&#8217;s expense, by releasing the plaintiff from the expense of a further performance at a loss. In summary, the fact that the defendant has committed a material breach does not mean that the contract is to be disregarded, allow- ing the plaintiff to seek restitution as if there had never been a contract be- tween the parties. Such precisely is the legal response where the contract was never valid to begin with, as in a case of rescission for fraud. It is not and has never been the remedy for breach of a valid and enforceable contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Accepting the contract price as a limit in a losing-contract case does not mean that expectation and perfor- mance-based damages are invariably the same. Because the plaintiff per- forming at a loss is allowed to cease performance (and terminate any re- maining obligation) in response to the defendant&#8217;s breach or repudiation, the plaintiff avoids the further loss that would have been sustained in complet- ing performance. In other words, the loss that would have been realized by the plaintiff in completing performance of the contract is not subtracted from the plaintiff&#8217;s recovery for partial per- formance. The result is explained by viewing the defendant&#8217;s breach or re- pudiation as a gratuitous release of the plaintiff&#8217;s further obligations under the contract. A defendant who wishes to be paid for releasing the plaintiff from an onerous obligation&#8212;a plausible resolu- tion on the facts of some losing-contract cases&#8212;must negotiate with the plain- tiff to settle the contract by agreement. If the rule were otherwise &#8230; the de- fendant would be in the position of imposing a unilateral modification or novation, on the terms most favorable to himself; and of doing so, moreover, by breach rather than by negotiation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Consequential harms.</i> Deci- sions authorizing &#8220;restitution&#8221; in ex- cess of the contract price to parties who have been performing at a loss are found disproportionately in cases of long-term contracts for construction or manufacture that have been interrupt- ed in the course of performance. Breach in such circumstances is particularly likely to subject the injured party to consequential harm; yet the plaintiff may face formidable difficulties in es- tablishing the fact and amount of the resulting loss, if proof of damages must be made with rigorous specificity. If in such a setting the court perceives that the defendant has obtained a perfor- mance that was unexpectedly costly to the plaintiff&#8212;and if the evidence more- over suggests that the plaintiff&#8217;s cost overruns may have their source in the defendant&#8217;s breach&#8212;a judgment that the defendant is liable for the market value of the plaintiff&#8217;s performance, although nominally explained on a theory of unjust enrichment, makes the plaintiff whole while avoiding the difficulties of proving the various ele- ments of consequential or special dam- ages. The practice in some jurisdictions of awarding damages in construction cases on a &#8220;total cost&#8221; basis relies on similar assumptions to achieve a simi- lar result.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Because it prohibits a recovery in excess of the contract price for the work done, &#167; 38 forecloses this use of a performance-based damage award; but <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>plaintiffs may obtain the same compen- sation if they can prove the necessary elements of special damages. A juris- diction that adopts the position of this Restatement should ensure that evi- dentiary requirements for proof of spe- cial damages caused by the defendant&#8217;s breach are not unduly restrictive. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 39. Profit from Opportunistic Breach</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If a deliberate breach of contract results in profit to the defaulting promisor and the available damage remedy affords inadequate protection to the promisee&#8217;s contractual entitlement, the promisee has a claim to restitution of the profit realized by the promisor as a result of the breach. Restitution by the rule of this section is an alternative to a remedy in damages.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A case in which damages afford inadequate protection to the promisee&#8217;s contractual entitlement is ordinarily one in which damages will not permit the promisee to acquire a full equivalent to the promised performance in a substitute transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Breach of contract is profitable when it results in gains to the de- fendant (net of potential liability in damages) greater than the defendant would have realized from performance of the contract. Profits from breach include saved expenditure and consequential gains that the defendant would not have realized but for the breach, as measured by the rules that apply in other cases of disgorgement.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> In excep- tional cases, a party&#8217;s profitable breach of contract may be a source of unjust enrichment at the expense of the other contracting party. The law of restitu- tion treats such cases in the same way that it treats other instances of inten- tional and profitable interference with another person&#8217;s legally protected in- terests, authorizing a claim by the in- jured party to the measurable benefit realized as a result of the defendant&#8217;s wrong. The claim described in this sec- tion is accordingly an instance of resti- tution for benefits wrongfully obtained (&#167; 3). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Unlike &#167;&#167; 37&#8211;38, which describe contract remedies that are independent of unjust enrichment, a primary object of &#167; 39 is to prevent the unjust enrich- ment of the defendant at the expense of the plaintiff. Like the other rules of restitution for benefits wrongfully ob- tained, &#167; 39 describes a disgorgement remedy: a claimant under this section may recover the defendant&#8217;s profits from breach, even if they exceed the provable loss to the claimant from the defendant&#8217;s defaulted performance. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Judged by the usual presumptions of contract law, a recovery for breach that exceeds the plaintiff&#8217;s provable dam- ages is anomalous on its face. A breach of contract&#8212;whatever the actor&#8217;s state of mind&#8212;is not usually treated in law as a wrong to the injured party of a sort comparable to a tort or breach of equi- table duty. There is substantial truth, though not of course the whole story, in the Holmesian paradox according to which the legal obligation imposed by contract lies in a choice between perfor- mance and payment of damages. But the observation is most accurate where it matters least: in those transactional contexts where damages can be calcu- lated with relative confidence as a full equivalent of performance. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Compared to other forms of legal entitlement, contract rights may often be easier to value in money; but they would be vulnerable to the same risks of underenforcement if the exclusive remedy for breach were an action for money damages. Where a party&#8217;s con- tractual entitlement would be inad- equately protected by the legal rem- edy of damages for breach, a court will often reinforce the protection given to the claimant by an order of injunction or specific performance. Restitution af- fords comparable protection after the fact, awarding the gains from a profit- able breach of a contract that the de- fendant can no longer be required to perform. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Opportunistic breach.</i> The common rationale of every instance in which restitution allows a recovery of profits from wrongdoing, in the con- tractual context or any other, is the reinforcement of an entitlement that would be inadequately protected if li- ability for interference were limited to provable damages. Cases in which restitution reaches the profits from a breach of contract are those in which the promisee&#8217;s contractual position is vulnerable to abuse. Vulnerability in this context stems from the difficulty that the promisee may face in recov- ering, as compensatory damages, a full equivalent of the performance for which the promisee has bargained. A promisor who was permitted to exploit the shortcomings of the promisee&#8217;s damage remedy could accept the price of the promised performance, then de- liver something less than what was promised. Such an outcome results in unjust enrichment as between the par- ties. The mere possibility of such an outcome undermines the stability of any contractual exchange in which one party&#8217;s performance may be neither easily compelled nor easily valued.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A promisor who recognizes this possibility and attempts to profit by it commits what is here called an &#8220;oppor- tunistic breach.&#8221; The label suggests the reasons why a breach of this character is condemned, but there is no require- ment under this section that the claim- ant prove the motivation of the breach- ing party.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In countering this form of oppor- tunism, the rule of &#167; 39 reinforces the contractual position of the vulnerable party and condemns a form of con- scious advantage-taking that is the equivalent, in the contractual context, of an intentional and profitable tort. A restitution claim in response to a profitable tort typically operates to protect property from deliberate in- terference: standard examples include the claim to profits from trespass or infringement. See &#167;&#167; 40 and 42. The rule of &#167; 39 extends an analogous pro- tection to contract rights, where what the wrongdoer seeks to acquire is not &#8220;property&#8221; but the modification or re- lease of his own contractual obligation. The two situations have much in com- mon. Confronted with a situation&#8212;in either context&#8212;in which the appropri- ate course of action would be to nego- tiate regarding legal entitlements, the wrongdoer takes without asking. The opportunistic calculation in either set- ting is that the wrongdoer&#8217;s anticipated liability in damages is less than the an- ticipated cost of the entitlement, were it to be purchased from the claimant in a voluntary transaction. Restitution (through the disgorgement remedy) seeks to defeat this calculation, reduc- ing the likelihood that the conscious disregard of another&#8217;s entitlement can be more advantageous than its nego- tiated acquisition. See &#167; 3, Comment c. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Where the value of the promised performance is easily demonstrated&#8212;and substitutes are readily available&#8212;it may be plausible to attribute to the parties an understanding that the promisor shall be free, as a practical matter, to elect between performance and payment of damages. In other <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>transactions&#8230; the proposition that the promisor should be free to choose whether or not to perform would be incompatible with fundamental objec- tives of the promisee, ultimately mak- ing it impossible to fix a price for the promisor&#8217;s contractual obligation. Ab- sent an enforceable agreement on liq- uidated damages, the bargain in ques- tion is then less likely to be made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Not by coincidence, the contractual entitlements that are vulnerable in the manner just described are those for which the promisee would most often be entitled to protection by injunction, or to a remedy by specific performance; or in which well-advised parties would most often provide by contract (where permitted to do so) for liquidated dam- ages or specific enforceability. Dis- gorgement by the rule of this section serves the same contract-reinforcing objectives as the devices just men- tioned, at a different stage of contrac- tual performance. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. When disgorgement is avail- able.</i> The cases in which the law allows disgorgement for breach of contract are susceptible of various particularized explanations; the purpose of &#167; 39 is to frame a rule that will identify them all. It has been suggested, for exam- ple, that a contractual entitlement to acquire real property may sufficiently resemble ownership of the property (by the doctrine of equitable conversion or otherwise) that it is natural to treat a breach of the sales contract as an inter- ference with the property right&#8212;there- by justifying recourse to the restitution claim that would be available in a case of interference with real property. &#8230; In cases of this kind, where specific performance is routinely available, it has long been assumed that damages are inadequate to protect the contrac- tual entitlement of the promisee. Res- titution gives the protection after the fact that specific performance would have given ahead of time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In other contexts as well, contract rights may resemble noncontractual entitlements that are routinely pro- tected against interference by a dis- gorgement remedy in restitution. Thus a promise not to disclose or utilize con- fidential information is the usual form by which trade secrets are protected; allowing restitution for breach of the contract is equivalent to restitution for misappropriation of the trade secret. Again, if one party&#8217;s contractual ob- ligation to another has a fiduciary or confidential character, disgorgement for breach of the contract might be jus- tified by observing that it resembles a liability to account for profits derived from a breach of fiduciary duty. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In a further set of cases, the nature of the underlying transaction makes it fair to surmise that the plaintiff has (in effect) paid the defendant in advance for a performance that the defendant has failed to render. If the circumstanc- es of the transaction are such that the plaintiff can obtain neither rescission nor a meaningful remedy in damages, restitution by the rule of &#167; 39 yields a monetary substitute for the perfor- mance the plaintiff paid for and should have received.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">&#8230; 5. Landowner and Mining Company enter a contract for strip- mining. The agreement authorizes Mining Company to remove coal from Blackacre in exchange for pay- ment of a specified royalty per ton. A further provision of the agree- ment, included at Landowner&#8217;s in- sistence, obliges Mining Company to restore the surface of Blackacre to its preexisting contours on the completion of mining operations. Mining Company removes the coal from Blackacre, pays the stipulated royalty, and repudiates its obliga- tion to restore the land. In Land- owner&#8217;s action against Mining Com- pany it is established that the cost <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of restoration would be $25,000, and that the diminution in the value of Blackacre if the restoration is not performed would be negligible. The contract is not affected by mistake or impracticability. The cost of res- toration is in line with what Mining Company presumably anticipated, and the available comparisons sug- gest that Mining Company took this cost into account in calculating the contractual royalty. Landowner is entitled to recover $25,000 from Mining Company by the rule of this section. It is not a condition to Landowner&#8217;s recovery in restitution that the money be used to restore Blackacre. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Measure of recovery.</i> The pur- pose of the disgorgement remedy for breach of contract is to eliminate the possibility that an intentional and op- portunistic breach will be more prof- itable to the performing party than negotiation with the party to whom performance is owed. For this reason, &#8220;profit realized &#8230; as a result of the breach&#8221; includes the gains that moti- vated the promisor&#8217;s decision to breach the contract. If the defendant&#8217;s liabil- ity in restitution were limited to the amount that might have been paid to obtain the necessary contractual modi- fication in a voluntary transaction, there would be inadequate incentive to bargain over the entitlement in ques- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">While the rule of this section is in- tended to make breach unprofitable, it does not seek to punish a breach of contract by requiring forfeiture of the defendant&#8217;s profit from the transaction as a whole. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. The exceptional nature of the claim.</i> Of the available remedies for breach of contract, the disgorgement claim described in &#167; 39 is the least frequently encountered. The cumula- tive requirements of &#167; 39 will exclude the great majority of contractual de- faults. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Even when breach is both profit- able and deliberate&#8212;in the sense that it results from a conscious choice not to perform&#8212;there is no opportunism and no claim under this section if a damage remedy affords adequate protection to the promisee&#8217;s contractual entitlement, by allowing the promisee &#8220;to acquire a full equivalent to the promised perfor- mance in a substitute transaction.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Efficient breach.</i> Modern American contract scholarship devotes considerable attention to a hypotheti- cal case in which breach of contract is &#8220;efficient.&#8221; The scenario most often de- bated involves a seller who is offered a higher price for goods or services that he has sold but not yet delivered to the buyer. The seller&#8212;it is suggested&#8212;ought to breach the contract whenever the anticipated profits from resale at the higher price would be more than sufficient to pay the buyer&#8217;s damages, thereby leaving some parties better off and nobody worse off. An efficient breach of contract by this definition is easy to hypothesize but difficult to find in real life. In a market context, gain to one party is normally offset or exceeded by loss to the other; while the test of efficiency will not be met unless the in- jured party is fully indemnified against the cost of resolving the resulting dis- pute. American practice regarding the allocation of litigation expense makes satisfaction of the latter condition es- pecially unlikely. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The rationale of the disgorgement liability in restitution, in a contractual context or any other, is inherently at odds with the idea of efficient breach in its usual connotation. Given the pervasive risk of undercompensation by standard damage measures, not to mention the deadweight loss from the cost of litigation, the law of restitution strongly favors voluntary over involun- tary transactions in the adjustment of conflicts over any form of legal entitle- ment. A voluntary transaction in the present context requires a negotiated <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>release or modification of the existing obligation. The obligor who elects in- stead to take without asking&#8212;calcu- lating that his anticipated liability for breach is less than the price he would have to pay to purchase the rights in question, and leaving the obligee to the chance of a recovery in damages&#8212;en- gages in precisely the conduct that the law of restitution normally condemns.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Whether the promisor&#8217;s decision to modify or withhold a given perfor- mance infringes the contract rights of the promisee is a preliminary question of contract law and interpretation. If it does, the promisor&#8217;s liability in restitu- tion follows from the same principles as restitution for other instances of conscious and profitable interference with legally protected rights. The rule of &#167; 39 does not automatically punish every &#8220;efficient breach&#8221; with a dis- gorgement remedy, because it applies only when a remedy in damages is in- adequate to protect the promisee&#8217;s en- titlement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Equitable limitations.</i> If a con- tract is one that a court would decline to enforce by specific performance or in- junction on the ground that such relief would impose undue hardship or would otherwise be inequitable to the default- ing party, disgorgement by the rule of &#167; 39 will be inappropriate for the same reasons, notwithstanding the fact that the breach is both profitable and delib- erate.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">One important case in which equita- ble limitations preclude disgorgement involves the uncontroversial version of &#8220;efficient breach.&#8221; Where contrac- tual performance would be manifestly wasteful&#8212;imposing unexpected costs on the performing party that yield no corresponding (or bargained-for) ben- efit to the recipient&#8212;a court will refuse specific performance on the ground of disproportionate hardship. Under such circumstances, it is the party who in- sists on specific performance who is be- having opportunistically.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Even if a promised performance is fully within the scope of the parties&#8217; bargain, specific enforcement may be denied for policy reasons that would make it anomalous to order disgorge- ment after the fact. By contrast, some of the most frequent reasons for the un- availability of specific performance&#8212;either the burden of supervision, or the sheer difficulty of obtaining timely relief&#8212;have no application to a remedy via disgorgement after the fact. Unlike the all-or-nothing remedy of specific performance, moreover, a claim to dis- gorgement of profits under &#167; 39 permits some shaping of the remedy to accord with the equities between the par- ties, if only in the measurement of the profits &#8220;realized &#8230; as a result of the breach.&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A claimant entitled to restitution may obtain a judgment for mon- ey in the amount of the defendant&#8217;s unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Enrichment from a money payment is measured by the amount of the payment or the resulting increase in the defendant&#8217;s net assets, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Enrichment from the receipt of nonreturnable benefits may be measured by</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) the cost to the claimant of conferring the benefit,</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(c) the market value of the benefit, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) a price the defendant has expressed a willingness to pay, if the defendant&#8217;s assent may be treated as valid on the question of price.</p>

<p class="indent">(4) When restitution is intended to strip the defendant of a wrongful gain, the standard of liability is not the value of the benefit conferred but the amount of the profit wrongfully obtained. Unjust enrichment in such cases is measured by the rules of &#167; 51(4)&#8211;(5).</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Supplemental enrichment in the form of interest or use value, proceeds, and consequential gains is recognized as stated in &#167; 53.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections. &#8230;</i> The pres- ent section identifies six potentially dif- ferent standards for measuring enrich- ment. The task is not as complicated as this might make it seem, however, because the circumstances of a given transaction will usually eliminate most choices&#8212;leaving only one or two means by which enrichment might plausibly be measured.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Many restitution cases pose no appreciable problem of measure- ment within the rule of this section. Enrichment resulting from a money payment is easily determined in most cases (&#167; 49(2)). When restitution aims to deprive the defendant of a wrong- ful gain, enrichment is measured as stated in &#167; 51(4)&#8211;(5). The disgorgement rules involve complexities of their own, but they shift the focus of the remedy from measuring the value of a benefit to measuring the profits derived from wrongful conduct (&#167; 49(4)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The measurement of enrichment from nonreturnable benefits is poten- tially more difficult (&#167; 49(3)), but the problem of choosing between conflict- ing measures of enrichment will not necessarily arise even here. Frequently the circumstances of the transaction are such that the defendant&#8217;s unjust enrichment can plausibly be measured in only one way. At other times, two or more possible measures of enrichment will yield the same result. For example, when a professional recovers in restitu- tion for the value of services rendered pursuant to an unenforceable contract (&#167; 31), there will not necessarily be a meaningful distinction between the value of the services to the recipient, their cost to the claimant, their market value, and a price fixed by the unen- forceable agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The significance of the different measures of enrichment from non- returnable benefits, therefore, is not that they necessarily yield different amounts, but that they sometimes yield different amounts. When they do, the choice between them is dic- tated by general principles of unjust enrichment, turning chiefly on the in- nocence or blameworthiness of the de- fendant. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Liability, remedy, and de- fenses distinguished.</i> The rules of the present section (and of the other sec- tions within this Topic) address only the <i>extent</i> of a liability in restitution, once the question of liability has been decided by application of rules appear- ing elsewhere in this Restatement. The fact that a person has been demon- strably enriched at the expense of the claimant, by one of the measures iden- tified in &#167; 49, does not suffice to estab- lish either unjust enrichment or liabil- ity in restitution. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>d. Value to the recipient.</i> This Re- statement inherits the formula &#8220;value in advancing the purposes of the re- cipient&#8221; from Restatement of Restitu- tion &#167; 155 (1937). An expression such as &#8220;subjective value to the recipient&#8221; is often used to convey the same idea. The word &#8220;subjective&#8221; is potentially misleading in this context, because subjective values are often values that are entirely incapable of measure- ment. But restitution does not impose a liability in money for any enrichment that cannot be valued with reasonable confidence. The relevant comparison is normally between demonstrable value to the recipient, given what we know about the recipient&#8217;s situation, and the available measures of market value be- tween willing buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">So understood, &#8220;value to the recipi- ent&#8221; is usually the most restrictive (and therefore the most favorable to the de- fendant) of the available measures of enrichment. Where this measure ap- plies, a claimant will not necessarily succeed in demonstrating enrichment by showing that the benefits conferred have market value, or even that the recipient&#8217;s illiquid assets have been in- creased by market measures, because restitution avoids subjecting the inno- cent recipient to a forced exchange. See &#167; 2(4); &#167; 9, Comment <i>a</i>; &#167; 50(3). These protective features make &#8220;value to the recipient&#8221; the usual measure of enrich- ment in all cases where an innocent recipient has obtained unrequested, nonreturnable benefits. Given the po- tential inefficiency of most nonconsen- sual transactions&#8212;such as benefits conferred by mistake&#8212;either market value or cost to the claimant frequently exceeds value to the recipient. If the recipient is not at fault in the transac- tion, liability in restitution is limited to the least of these amounts (&#167; 50(2) (a)). Because the innocent recipient is protected against prejudice from the transaction, the claimant necessarily bears any loss that results from the dif- ference between the cost and value of the benefit conferred.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In such circumstances, &#8220;value to the recipient&#8221; stands in sharp contrast to the other measures of enrichment; but there are cases in which the most natural approximation of &#8220;value to the recipient&#8221; may be cost of performance, market value, or even contract price. For example, market value is the usual measure of &#8220;value to the recipient&#8221; in cases of restitution for emergency ser- vices protecting life and health. &#8230; By contrast, where the beneficial nature of the services will not be presumed&#8212;as where the claimant acts in an emer- gency to preserve property, rather than life or health&#8212;the recipient will be li- able in restitution for the amount of the loss avoided or for reasonable com- pensation to the claimant, whichever is less. &#8230; If the terms of the parties&#8217; unenforceable contract reveal the price that the defendant was willing to pay for a requested performance, the price so specified&#8212;although unenforceable by an action on the contract&#8212;may be the best evidence of &#8220;value to the re- cipient.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Cost to the claimant.</i> Cost to the claimant recurs as the appropriate measure of enrichment in four kinds of cases:</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(1) When restitution is avail- able for goods or services having no established market price, the cost of providing the benefit may fur- nish the best&#8212;or the only&#8212;means of measuring the recipient&#8217;s enrich- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(2) If the value of an unre- quested benefit exceeds its cost to the claimant, an innocent recipient will be liable only for the cost. See &#167; 50(4). &#8220;Cost or value, whichever is less&#8221; is thus the standard recovery in cases of mistaken improvement, if restitution is available at all from an owner not at fault. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(3) Conversely, where the measurable value of a benefit is less than the cost of conferring it, a recipient who is at fault in the transaction creating unjust enrich- ment may be liable to make restitu- tion in the amount of the claimant&#8217;s costs. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(4) A court that allows recov- ery in restitution for performance under an unenforceable contract&#8212;where the reason for unenforce- ability is <i>malum prohibitum</i> such as regulatory noncompliance&#8212;will sometimes measure enrichment by the claimant&#8217;s cost of performance, in preference to contract price or market value. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Market value.</i> Liability in res- titution for the market value of goods or services is the remedy traditionally known as quantum meruit. It is the usual measurement of enrichment in cases where nonreturnable benefits have been furnished at the defendant&#8217;s request, but where the parties made no enforceable agreement as to price. See &#167; 31, Comment <i>e</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The measurement of unjust enrich- ment is significantly affected by the fact that the defendant requested the benefits in question and&#8212;implicitly, at least&#8212;expressed a willingness to pay for them. Where benefits are un- requested, their market value will be relevant (if at all) only as a way to dem- onstrate their value &#8220;in advancing the purposes of the defendant&#8221;&#8212;as when the claimant&#8217;s performance has spared the defendant an otherwise necessary expense. &#8230; By contrast, benefits con- ferred at the defendant&#8217;s request are presumed to have value to the recipient equal to the lesser of market value and a price the defendant has expressed a willingness to pay, unless the circum- stances of the transaction make this valuation inappropriate. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Contract price.</i> A price fixed by agreement does not conclusively es- tablish the value of benefits conferred if the parties&#8217; contract is invalid or un- enforceable under applicable law. But even an unenforceable contract may serve to establish value for restitution purposes, if the grounds of unenforce- ability do not draw into question the validity of the parties&#8217; agreement as to price.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Whether the contract price is ul- timately acceptable as the measure of benefit for restitution purposes de- pends on the reasons why the claimant seeks a remedy in restitution rather than on the contract. A variety of cir- cumstances may lead to a conclusion that the enrichment of the recipient from the claimant&#8217;s contractual perfor- mance is something less than a price the recipient once offered to pay. See &#167; 50, Comment <i>e</i>. Conversely, the inno- cent recipient of a contractual perfor- mance will in no case be liable in res- titution for an amount exceeding the contract price. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(Breach of contract does not or- dinarily constitute the kind of legal wrong that would expose the recipient of performance to a liability in resti- tution exceeding the unpaid contract price. See &#167; 2(2); &#167; 44, Comment <i>a</i>. This Restatement recognizes a narrow ex- ception to this rule in cases of profit- able, opportunistic breach as described in &#167; 39. Measurement of unjust enrich- ment in such a case is within the rule of &#167; 51(4).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">If the claimant has rendered a con- forming performance under a contract that is unenforceable solely for want of formality&#8212;the standard example being a contract that fails to satisfy the applicable Statute of Frauds&#8212;the value of the performance to the recipi- ent is presumptively equal to the lesser of contract price and market value, two measures that are frequently identi- cal (&#167; 50(2)(b)). &#8230; If instead of a price in money the same contract specifies a counterperformance that the recipient <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>cannot be compelled to render, the implied price of the claimant&#8217;s perfor- mance&#8212;and its presumptive value to the recipient, for restitution purpos- es&#8212;is the market rate for the perfor- mance in question. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 50. Innocent Recipient</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An &#8220;innocent recipient&#8221; is one who commits no misconduct in the transaction concerned (&#167; 51) and who bears no responsibility for the un- just enrichment in question (&#167; 52).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If nonreturnable benefits would be susceptible of different valu- ations by the standards identified in &#167; 49(3), the liability of an innocent recipient is determined as follows:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) Unjust enrichment from unrequested benefits is measured by the standard that yields the smallest liability in restitution.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) Unjust enrichment from requested benefits is measured by their reasonable value to the recipient. Reasonable value is normally the lesser of market value and a price the recipient has expressed a willingness to pay.</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) Reasonable value may be measured by a more restrictive stan- dard if the validity of the recipient&#8217;s assent is in question (&#167; 49(3)(d)); if the claimant has not performed as requested (&#167; 36); or if prevailing prices include an element of profit that the court decides to withhold from the claimant.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The liability in restitution of an innocent recipient of unrequested benefits may not leave the recipient worse off (apart from the costs of litigation) than if the transaction giving rise to the liability had not oc- curred.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The liability in restitution of an innocent recipient of unrequested benefits may not exceed the cost to the claimant of conferring the benefits in question, supplemented when appropriate by the rules of &#167; 53.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) An innocent recipient may be liable in an appropriate case for use value or proceeds, but not for consequential gains (&#167; 53).</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> Restitution may require a choice between two or more measures of the defendant&#8217;s un- just enrichment, as set forth in &#167; 49. The principles that determine this choice turn chiefly on the extent to which the defendant is at fault in the transaction concerned. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Enrichment by money pay- ment. &#8230;</i> The rule that limits recov- ery in restitution to the amount of the claimant&#8217;s outlay (&#167; 50(4)) is consistent with the proposition that an innocent recipient is not liable in restitution for consequential gains (&#167; 50(5)). See &#167; 53, Comment <i>d</i>. By contrast, there are circumstances in which the benefit derived by an innocent recipient from property of fluctuating value is most appropriately measured by the pro- ceeds (in money) received on its even- tual disposition. See &#167; 53, Comment <i>c</i> &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>c. Unrequested benefits.</i> The sharpest contrasts between compet- ing measures of enrichment appear in cases of unrequested, nonreturnable benefits, such as services conferred by mistake. A benefit that is costly to con- fer, with a substantial market value, may be of no value at all in advancing the purposes of the recipient. See &#167; 49, Comment <i>d</i>. In such cases the unjust enrichment of an innocent recipient is ordinarily calculated by whichever of the available measures&#8212;as identified in &#167; 49(3)&#8212;yields the smallest liability in restitution (&#167; 50(2)(a)). Because &#8220;val- ue to the recipient&#8221; is usually the most restrictive measure of enrichment, it is the customary measure of the res- titutionary liability of an innocent re- cipient of unrequested, nonreturnable benefits; though in particular contexts the rule of &#167; 50(2)(a) yields the formula &#8220;cost or value, whichever is less.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Requested benefits: reason- able value.</i> Sometimes the defendant has requested the goods or services by which the defendant is unjustly enriched. Such cases arise when the claimant renders a contractual per- formance that&#8212;for one reason or an- other&#8212;yields no enforceable contract claim (&#167;&#167; 31&#8211;36). In a distinct but closely related set of cases, a requested performance has been rendered in the mistaken belief that a contract exists, though in fact (as the court later de- termines) the parties never reached agreement. See &#167; 9, Comment <i>f &#8230;</i> The fact that benefits were conferred in response to a valid request is poten- tially of great significance to the issue of valuation for restitution purposes. This is not because the logic of unjust enrichment is different in such cases, but because the recipient&#8217;s prior re- quest tends to reveal the value to the recipient of the benefits in question.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When the claimant&#8217;s performance has been requested by the defendant, its value for restitution purposes is of- ten said to be its &#8220;reasonable value.&#8221; &#8230; Reasonable value in such a case is uniformly determined by reference to a market price or &#8220;going rate,&#8221; with- out consideration of alternatives such as cost to the claimant or value in ad- vancing the purposes of the defendant (&#167; 49(3)). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Combining these familiar results yields the rule of &#167; 50(2)(b), whereby the &#8220;reasonable value&#8221; of a requested performance is normally the lesser of (i) its market value, and (ii) a price the defendant offered to pay for it. So if a defendant has requested benefits without specifying a price, &#8220;reason- able value&#8221; in restitution is presump- tively fixed by market price. &#8230; But an innocent recipient who has offered to pay a given amount for a requested performance will not be required to pay a higher market value if the con- tract turns out to be unenforceable. &#8230; Conversely, the defendant&#8217;s liability in restitution is not reduced by evidence that a validly requested performance, rendered as requested, has proved to be less valuable in advancing the de- fendant&#8217;s purposes than the defendant expected. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Requested benefits: restricted measures of enrichment.</i> As stated in &#167; 50(2)(c), the rule by which requested benefits are measured by their reason- able value&#8212;with the presumption by which &#8220;reasonable value&#8221; is normally determined by reference to a contract or market price&#8212;is subject to qualifica- tion in a number of circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Plainly, the fact of a prior request by the recipient will not be taken to establish value if the circumstances of the request deprive it of significance for this purpose. See Comment <i>d</i>. Invali- dating factors such as fraud or incapac- ity may or may not have this effect in a particular case. &#8230; [T]he recipient&#8217;s assent proves nothing about value of services for restitution purposes if the recipient has been deceived about the price or quality of what he is to receive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>If restitution is allowed in respect of benefits furnished to a recipient lack- ing capacity to contract (&#167; 33), the mea- sure of enrichment is often the lesser of contract price or market value. But if the incapacitated party cannot be presumed to derive the usual advan- tage from the benefits in question&#8212;the basis of any market price&#8212;enrichment may be measured as if the benefits were unrequested. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Recovery in restitution for request- ed benefits is sometimes restricted for other reasons. If the reason the parties&#8217; contract is unenforceable is a regula- tory infraction by the claimant&#8212;such as a failure to obtain a license, or to adhere to a prescribed method of doing business&#8212;a court may be willing to al- low a recovery in restitution (avoiding an entire forfeiture and the consequent unjust enrichment of the recipient), but not to value the benefit conferred by the claimant&#8217;s performance at the contract or market price, since such a valuation would not impose any pen- alty for the infraction. One possibility in such a case is to allow recovery in the amount of the claimant&#8217;s cost of performance, thereby eliminating the element of profit. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Innocent recipients: protec- tive rules. &#8230;</i> The rules as stated [in subsections (3) and (4)] follow largely (though not entirely) from subsection (2)(a), making them to that extent re- dundant. The justification of these fa- miliar limits derives from axiomatic propositions about the nature of liabil- ity in unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, because the basis of liabil- ity is the enrichment of the recipient, a judgment in restitution cannot be justified if it exceeds the defendant&#8217;s enrichment, properly measured. It can be useful to ask whether a proposed outcome leaves the recipient worse off than if the entire transaction had not occurred, because the question di- rects our attention to the various ways in which the value of the benefit con- ferred&#8212;by the claimant&#8217;s proposed measure&#8212;might be less than its value in advancing the purposes of the recipi- ent. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, in the unusual case in which the value to the recipient of an unrequested benefit exceeds the cost of conferring it, the restitutionary liabil- ity of an innocent recipient will not ex- ceed the amount required to indemnify the claimant. The axiom underlying this second limitation has been vari- ously expressed. It is often suggested that a person can be <i>unjustly</i> enriched only to the extent that the benefit in question has been conferred &#8220;at the expense of the claimant&#8221; &#8230; Once the claimant has been indemnified, there is&#8212;in the absence of contract&#8212;no rea- son why the innocent recipient of a benefit, however valuable, should pay anything more. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The most common application of the rule stated in &#167; 50(3) is to cases in which a claimant supplies unrequested goods or services whose value in ad- vancing the purposes of the recipient is less than their value to a willing buyer. In such a case, &#167; 50(3) states a rule of thumb that safeguards the innocent recipient against prejudice by assign- ing to the restitution claimant any loss from an inefficient noncontractual ex- change. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In circumstances where the value to the recipient of an unrequested benefit might plausibly exceed the cost to the claimant of conferring it, application of &#167; 50(4) yields the familiar formula by which the recipient&#8217;s liability is said to be &#8220;cost or benefit, whichever is less.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A person who has transferred money or other property is entitled to recover it by rescission and restitution if</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the transaction is invalid or subject to avoidance for a reason identified in another section of this Restatement, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the further requirements of this section may be satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Rescission requires a mutual restoration and accounting in which each party</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) restores property received from the other, to the extent such restoration is feasible,</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) accounts for additional benefits obtained at the expense of the other as a result of the transaction and its subsequent avoidance, as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) compensates the other for loss from related expenditure as justice may require.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Rescission is limited to cases in which counter-restitution by the claimant will restore the defendant to the status quo ante, unless</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the defendant is fairly compensated for any deficiencies in the restoration made by the claimant, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the fault of the defendant or the assignment of risks in the underlying transaction makes it equitable that the defendant bear any uncompensated loss.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Rescission is appropriate when the interests of justice are served by allowing the claimant to reverse the challenged transaction instead of enforcing it. As a general rule:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) If the claimant seeks to reverse a transfer induced by fraud or other conscious wrongdoing, the limitation described in subsection (3) is liberally construed in favor of the claimant.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections.</i> Rescission is the common, shorthand name for a composite remedy (more fully, &#8220;rescis- sion and restitution&#8221;) that combines the avoidance of a transaction and the mutual restoration of performance thereunder. A judicial decree of rescis- sion typically provides for (i) the nullifi- cation of a transfer of property between the claimant and the defendant, (ii) the restoration of performance on either side, and (iii) a mutual accounting in which each party pays for benefits re- ceived from the other in consequence of the underlying exchange and its subse- quent reversal.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A party seeking rescission and restitution must first establish a sub- stantive right to avoidance of the transaction in question. As a further requirement, the proponent of rescis- sion must show that the unwinding of performance (as opposed to a rem- edy by money judgment) is both fea- sible and equitable on the facts of the case. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Rescission as a remedy for unjust enrichment usually allows the claim- ant to recover property that has been transferred to the defendant pursu- ant to contract. Performance may be reversed when the contract proves to be invalid by reason of fraud, duress, undue influence, incapacity, or lack of authority (&#167;&#167; 13&#8211;17), or when it is subject to avoidance on grounds such as mistake (&#167; 34) or breach of fiduciary duty (&#167; 43).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In a different set of cases, also aris- ing in a contractual context, rescission and restitution may be available as an alternative to damages for material breach (&#167; 37). Rescission as a remedy for breach is available only in those circumstances indicated by &#167; 37 (and subject to the express limitation of &#167; 37(2)). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. The availability of rescission.</i> A perfect rescission would restore both parties to the status quo ante by spe- cific restitution of property previously transferred, leaving no unjust enrich- ment, no loss to either party (apart from the defendant&#8217;s loss of bargain), and no need for the court to place a val- ue on benefits conferred. &#8230; To the ex- tent that the court must determine the money value of nonreturnable benefits, a remedy that attempts to unwind the transaction may be no more equitable (or administratively efficient) than en- forcement by an award of damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Rescission is usually invoked in a contractual setting, where its effect is to release the claimant&#8212;with retroac- tive effect&#8212;from an exchange transac- tion with the other party. A claimant who is allowed to rescind has usually been given a choice between (i) deal- ing with the other party on the basis of their agreement, which the claimant was free to ratify and enforce, and (ii) dealing with the other party &#8220;off the contract,&#8221; where benefits that either party may have derived at the expense of the other give rise to a liability in unjust enrichment. The divergence between contractual and extracon- tractual values means that rescission and damages will often lead to differ- ent results. The strategic possibilities of the choice between remedies, and the potential for hardship to the party against whom rescission is sought, ex- plain the elaborate rules and the exten- sive case law regulating the availabil- ity of rescission as a remedial option.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The availability of rescission thus depends partly on the degree to which the parties&#8217; performance is capable of restoration in specie, and partly on the grounds of the claimant&#8217;s entitle- ment to relief. Rescission will almost certainly be available when the claim- ant seeks to escape from an agreement that was induced by the other party&#8217;s fraud or other wrongdoing. Even when a plaintiff seeks rescission as an alternative <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to damages for breach of a valid and enforceable contract, there are cer- tain simplified situations in which the potential advantages of rescission over damages&#8212;in terms of fairness to the plaintiff as well as remedial efficien- cy&#8212;appear so evident that a plaintiff is uniformly permitted to pursue either remedy. Such cases typically involve breach or repudiation by a defendant who has obtained the plaintiff&#8217;s per- formance without tendering any re- turn. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Factors relevant to this ultimate question are sometimes addressed di- rectly. Elsewhere they are implicit in a judicial conclusion that rescission would not be equitable under the cir- cumstances, or that it is not possible to place the parties <i>in statu quo</i>. Courts naturally consider the circumstances of the transaction; the quality of the par- ties&#8217; conduct; the relative ease or dif- ficulty of compensating the claimant&#8217;s injury in damages; and the fairness of limiting the claimant to a damage remedy. On the other side of the scale, they consider the difficulty of measur- ing noncontractual values; the burden to the defendant of being compelled to reverse a contractual exchange; and the extent of windfalls and forfeitures resulting from interim variation in the values being restored.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Restitution as a safeguard against forfeiture. &#8230;</i> Rescission of a valid and enforceable contract over- turns legitimate contractual expecta- tions on which both parties may have significantly relied. The most no- table form of reliance in this context is likely to consist in the defendant&#8217;s performance (or preparation for perfor- mance), resulting in a change of posi- tion to the extent that any performance is not capable of restoration and sub- sequent resale. The consequences of invalidating the contractual exchange will not be adverse to the party seek- ing rescission, because the remedy is chosen at the claimant&#8217;s election; but they impose a potential forfeiture on the party in breach, who stands to lose not only the benefit of the bargain but also the sunk costs of performance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The potentially inequitable con- sequences of rescission are therefore limited by the traditional requirement that the claimant make counter-resti- tution of property received under the contract, as a means of restoring both parties to the precontractual status quo. Such a rule reinforces signifi- cantly the stability of contractual price terms. If rescission were an optional remedy for any material breach of contract&#8212;with no requirement of res- toration by the plaintiff&#8212;the plaintiff might elect in every case between (i) enforcing the bargain and (ii) dealing with the defendant (in restitution) as if no bargain had ever been made. Such an outcome would expand the implied conditions of the bargain beyond recog- nized limits, giving the party injured by material breach the right not only to terminate the contract (that is, to cease his own performance and recover damages) but, in the alternative, to set aside the contract whenever it was ad- vantageous to do so. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A claimant (such as a fraud victim) who has been an innocent party to a legally defective exchange will ordinar- ily be able to rescind on making res- titution (in specie or in value) of any benefits conferred by the other party. Rescission is available on relatively lib- eral terms in such cases&#8212;especially if the defendant is a conscious wrongdo- er&#8212;because the underlying exchange is ineffective to determine the parties&#8217; respective entitlements. &#8230; Rescis- sion as a remedy for breach of contract is subject to more restrictive require- ments because of its potential to desta- bilize the contractual exchange, impos- ing what may be an effective forfeiture as a penalty for breach. See Comment <i>e</i>. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>e. Rescission as a remedy for breach of contract. &#8230;</i> When rescis- sion restores a performance rendered under a defective agreement&#8212;as when rescission unwinds an exchange that is invalid by reason of mistake, fraud, or duress&#8212;it can usually be understood as a remedy for unjust enrichment. By contrast, when rescission affords an al- ternative remedy for breach of a valid and enforceable contract (as permit- ted by the rule of &#167; 37)&#8212;a breach, in other words, that might be remedied by damages or specific performance&#8212;the effect and the justification of the rescis- sion remedy are significantly different. Rescission in such a case permits the injured party to make a fundamental election, choosing to go backward (to the status quo ante) instead of forward (by enforcement of the contractual ex- change). The advantages to the party entitled to this remedial election are self-evident, but the court must de- termine whether rescission in place of enforcement serves the interests of justice. Unlike the case of rescission for fraud or mistake, the justification of rescission as an alternative remedy for breach is not the avoidance of un- just enrichment, but a concern with fairness to the injured party combined with remedial economy. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Incidental or reliance loss.</i> Re- scission of the parties&#8217; exchange may leave the claimant with losses from related expenditures (as distinct from payment of the price) made in reliance on the transaction that is being set aside. Compensation of such loss by an award of damages is a remedy different in kind from rescission and restitution, but the remedies are not necessarily inconsistent when the claimant&#8217;s ba- sic entitlement is to be restored to the status quo ante. Damages measured by the claimant&#8217;s expenditure can be in- cluded in the accounting that accompa- nies rescission, in order to do complete justice in a single proceeding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Recovery of what are commonly called &#8220;incidental damages&#8221; may thus be allowed in connection with rescis- sion, consistent with the remedial objective of restoring the claimant to the precontractual position. &#8230; Reim- bursement of other forms of reliance expenditure&#8212;as distinguished from restitution of the claimant&#8217;s perfor- mance itself, in the form of the price paid&#8212;may likewise be included in the parties&#8217; accounting on rescission. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The fact that rescission is consis- tent with reimbursement of the claim- ant&#8217;s reliance expenditures in some cases should not be allowed to obscure the central distinction between avoid- ance of a contract and enforcement by an action for damages. Rescission con- templates a mutual restoration of per- formance without the need to compare contract and market values. Its most dramatic applications therefore permit a claimant to recover a prepaid price without proof of damages from the de- fendant&#8217;s breach. &#8230; By contrast, no measure of <i>damages</i> for breach of con- tract&#8212;including performance-based damages measured by the claimant&#8217;s expenditures&#8212;can be calculated with- out reference to contractual expecta- tions. Because a nonfraudulent breach does not make the defendant a guaran- tor of the profitability of the claimant&#8217;s bargain, damages measured by unre- imbursed expenditures are reduced by losses the claimant would have in- curred had there been full performance (&#167; 38(2)(a)). Accordingly, when the ground of rescission is breach of con- tract (&#167; 37), the claimant may not com- bine rescission with a claim to recover expenditures that would circumvent this fundamental limitation. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>j. Tender of restitution not a pre- condition.</i> Section 54(5) explicitly elim- inates previous requirements that the claimant tender restitution to the other party as a precondition of rescission. No distinction is recognized between rescission &#8220;at law&#8221; and &#8220;in equity.&#8221; The <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>effect of former distinctions to govern the right to jury trial in a suit for re- scission is a question outside the scope of this Restatement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The requirement of a prior ten- der carried implicit safeguards to the defendant that the present section imposes more directly. It reduced the risk of a one-sided restitution, whereby the defendant might be compelled to restore what had been received in the transaction without obtaining restitu- tion of what had been given. But there is no such danger when a judicial order can make restitution by one party con- ditional on counter-restitution by the other. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">[T]he requirement of prior ten- der imposed a procedural barrier as a proxy for a substantive rule, since it purported to bar from rescission all claimants who were unable (and had not merely neglected) to restore the other party to the status quo ante. This ostensibly simple rule, as already noted, engendered a host of exceptions. Section 54(3)(b) states a more realistic test, requiring the court to determine whether any loss that will be allocated by rescission is appropriately borne by the party against whom rescission is sought. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 63. Equitable Disqualification (Unclean Hands)</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Recovery in restitution to which an innocent claimant would be entitled may be limited or denied because of the claimant&#8217;s inequitable conduct in the transaction that is the source of the asserted liability.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General principles and scope; relation to other sections. &#8230;</i> A court that encounters an instance of prima facie unjustified enrichment may de- cide that the usual consequence&#8212;a li- ability and remedy in restitution&#8212;is not what equity requires in the cir- cumstances of the particular case. &#8230; The possibility that a court may refuse relief on this basis is classified within this Restatement, for convenience of organization, among the affirmative defenses to a liability in restitution. But the principle involved is in fact one of judicial forbearance, and its con- cern is with the disqualification of the claimant rather than the rightful posi- tion of the recipient.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Some prominent examples of equi- table disqualification involve the de- nial of a claim for benefits conferred pursuant to certain illegal contracts. Because the possibility of disqualifi- cation is particularly salient in this context, it qualifies the affirmative rule authorizing recovery (&#167; 32(3)). See Comment <i>b</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">There are cases in which the re- ceipt of a benefit at the expense of a wrongdoer might be thought to consti- tute poetic justice rather than unjust enrichment. &#8230; The recipient escapes liability, not because of the recipient&#8217;s equitable position, but because the court may deny the claimant a remedy to which an innocent party would be entitled as a matter of course. The idea is that a person who engages in inequi- table conduct may forfeit the right to a judicial determination of what &#8220;equity and good conscience&#8221; require of the oth- er party to the transaction. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The rule of &#167; 63 coincides in part, but only in part, with the equitable maxim that &#8220;he who comes into equity must come with clean hands.&#8221; The af- firmative defense described in this sec- tion is not restricted to claims that seek traditional forms of equitable relief; it may be interposed against claims that derive from the legal side of restitution as well. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>b. Illicit contract between claim- ant and recipient.</i> When a claimant seeks restitution for benefits conferred under a contract that is illegal or un- enforceable for reasons of public policy, equitable disqualification by the rule of this section may be a decisive ele- ment in the resolution of the claim. See &#167; 32(3). &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">If the claimant has rendered a valu- able performance to the recipient in a prohibited transaction, the court must decide&#8212;if the question is not governed by the language and objectives of the relevant statute&#8212;whether the appro- priate sanctions for violation include forfeiture of what would otherwise be the claimant&#8217;s entitlement to restitu- tion. This question is frequently ad- dressed by asking whether the claim- ant is equitably disqualified to assert the restitution claim. &#8230; The relative culpability of the claimant and the recipient in the transaction between them will sometimes, but not always, be taken into account. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The consequences for restitution are the same when the claimant has conferred a benefit under an agree- ment with the recipient that (while not inherently wrongful) was entered into for a wrongful purpose. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Restitution from an innocent recipient. &#8230;</i> The potential reach of equitable disqualification is &#8230; broad- er than a mere refusal to enforce or relieve against illegal transactions. Rather, the claimant&#8217;s misconduct may lead a court to deny relief to which a claimant would ordinarily be entitled, based on any of the headings of liability in restitution. &#8230;</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2.01 Default Rule of an At-Will Employment Relationship</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Either party may terminate an employment relationship with or without cause unless the right to do so is limited by a statute, other law or public policy, or an agreement between the parties, a binding employer promise, or a binding employer policy statement (&#167; 2.02).</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Rebuttable presumption of at- will employment.</i> At its core, employ- ment is a contractual relationship. The law of contracts rests on a series of default rules that provide starting points for bargaining between the par- ties. These default rules control in the event neither the parties&#8217; agreement nor the applicable law prescribe differ- ent rules. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The at-will presumption states a de- fault rule that applies when the agree- ment between the parties or other binding employer promise or employer policy statement under &#167; 2.02 does not provide for a definite term or contain a limit on the employer&#8217;s power to termi- nate the relationship. The default rule is also subject to contrary statute, law, or public policy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Contrary agreement; binding promise or statement.</i> Agreements and binding employer promises or employer policy statements that would overcome the presumption of at-will employment are discussed in &#167; 2.02. &#8230;</p>

Employer X and employee E enter into an employment agree- ment providing for a one-year term, renewable for an additional year if neither party serves the other with at least 30 days&#8217; notice prior to ter- mination of the one-year period. Two months into the relationship, X terminates the agreement. X is subject to liability for breach of contract (10 months of pay subject to mitigation of damages), because the parties&#8217; agreement provides for a definite term, which overcomes the presumption of at-will employ- ment. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Employer X and employee E enter into an employment agree- ment providing for a $50,000 &#8220;an- nual salary&#8221; plus benefits. Two months into the relationship, X serves E with notice of termination of the agreement. X is not, without more, in breach of contract because this agreement is presumed to pro- vide only for at-will employment. The statement of employment at an annual rate of salary does not, standing alone, guarantee a year&#8217;s employment or otherwise overcome the presumption of at-will sta- tus. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f.

Two months into the relationship, X announces that because of declining demand for X&#8217;s product, E will henceforth be paid at the annual rate of $40,000 plus benefits. E continues to work and sues for breach. Because no contractual, statutory, or public- policy restriction applies, X has not breached the at-will agreement by reducing E&#8217;s salary prospectively. (Note: This Illustration rests on the premise that the prior $50,000-per- year stated salary rate did not cre- ate a nonmodifiable right to that salary, see &#167; 2.06.)

The promise must be definite enough to reasonably induce the ac- tion taken in reliance on the promise and must in fact induce such reliance. See id. and Comment <i>b</i>. If the condi- tions for promissory estoppel are pres- ent, then a promise may be enforceable even though an agreement itself would not be enforceable for lack of a writ- ten document.

<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Agreements.</i> Typically, agree- ments between employers and their employees involve an exchange of ex- press promises, an offer contemplating acceptance by performance followed by such performance, or some other statement or conduct manifesting the employer&#8217;s promise and the employee indication of assent, although no par- ticular form of words is required. An agreement can provide for a definite term of employment whereby earlier termination of the agreement absent cause is a breach of contract (&#167; 2.03(a) (1)), or for an indefinite term yet re- quire cause for termination such that termination without cause is a breach (&#167; 2.03(a)(2)), or for an indefinite term yet containing no limitation on termi- nation (&#167; 2.01) except perhaps notice or a stipulated payment by the employer (&#167; 9.01(c)).</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Consideration or bargained- for exchange.</i> The agreements that come under this Section must be enforceable under generally applicable contract law. &#8230; The general contract require- ment of consideration or bargained-for exchange does not require identical or parallel consideration from both par- ties to the agreement. An employee&#8217;s promise to work for the employer at stated terms is ordinarily sufficient to support a number of promises by the employer, including, for example, a promise to provide the employment on the stated terms and a promise not to terminate the relationship before the contract term ends except for cause.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Unilateral contracts.</i> Some jurisdictions use a form of &#8220;unilateral contract&#8221; analysis to hold enforceable unilaterally promulgated employer statements that are provided to em- ployees who then continue working after receiving those statements. Even in the majority of jurisdictions not rely- ing on such analysis, certain employer policy statements (discussed in &#167; 2.05) may give rise to binding obligations even in the absence of consideration or bargained-for exchange or a showing that the employee detrimentally relied on the statements. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Mutuality.</i> Mutuality of obli- gation is not required for employment agreements to be enforceable. Even if an employer agrees to a &#8220;cause&#8221; limit on the authority to discharge or impose other discipline and, as is typical, the employee does not agree to eschew the prerogative to quit the job at any time, with or without cause, the employment agreement is nevertheless enforceable. Even when an employee does agree to provide cause for a voluntary termina- tion, the general rule is that specific performance is not available to enforce a &#8220;personal services&#8221; contract. &#8230; At the same time, the parties can provide for a reasonable period during which the departing employee will not solicit customers or employees for a compet- ing business; such a promise in appro- priate circumstances may be enforce- able by injunction. &#8230; The parties can also require the employee to give advance notice of an intention to quit employment if the employee wishes to receive severance pay or other benefits that are not vested in the circumstanc- es. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Implied terms.</i> In some cases, the parties to an otherwise enforceable employment agreement expressly or impliedly refer to stated policies or es- tablished practices of the employer or in the trade to supply omitted terms in the agreement.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Indefinite-term agreements.</i> Agreements that limit the employer&#8217;s power to terminate the employment relationship can override the presump- tion of at-will employment even if the employment term is indefinite. This Section thus departs from decisions holding that contracts for indefinite employment should always be treated as contracts terminable at will or as tantamount to such contracts unless the employee can meet special proof burdens to defeat the at-will presump- tion. &#8230;</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">6. At his August 1 job in- terview with X Corporation, E, a biochemist living in California, in- quires about future job security if he were to accept a job with X. X&#8217;s president responds that E would enjoy &#8220;permanent employment&#8221; and adds: &#8220;I hope you will stay forever.&#8221; On August 31, X&#8217;s president writes to E stating &#8220;this letter confirms our offer to you for employment as a biochemist at an initial salary of $50,000 per year.&#8221; In October, E moves to Connecticut to begin work in X&#8217;s facility there on November 1. On his first day on the job, E is given a copy of X&#8217;s personnel man- ual. It states that X &#8220;reserves the right to hire, discharge for cause, promote, demote, reclassify, and assign work to employees.&#8221; A year later, E is provided with an updated version of the manual that omits any reference to &#8220;for cause&#8221; in con- nection with any discharge or other personnel-management decisions. On these facts, the trier of fact can decide that X and E entered into an agreement for an indefinite term with a limitation on X&#8217;s right to dis- charge E without &#8220;cause.&#8221; The later manual&#8217;s omission of the &#8220;for cause&#8221; language does not remove the cause limitation in the agreement be- tween X and E.</p>

Because sophisti- cated parties would typically enter into a written agreement setting forth the terms of such an unusual agreement promising a prospective managerial employee essentially lifetime employment absent cause to terminate, X and E may well have understood that X&#8217;s oral statements that E would have &#8220;permanent em- ployment&#8221; and &#8220;stay forever&#8221; were not intended as a binding prom- ise of lifetime employment absent cause. But E reasonably may have understood the statements in pre- cisely those terms. If the terms of the parties&#8217; agreement are ambigu- ous, the trier of fact may consider the parties&#8217; bargaining history and the employer&#8217;s relevant policies, procedures, or practices.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Indefinite-term agreements.</i> When parties have negotiated an in- definite-term agreement containing a cause limitation on the employer&#8217;s power to terminate, the definition of cause to which the parties have agreed controls. However, if the agreement is silent on the question, then given the potential length of indefinite-term agreements, the reasonable assump- tion is that the parties intended, in ad- dition to the grounds stated in &#167; 2.04(a), to include significant changes in the employer&#8217;s economic circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Factual cause.</i> When the par- ties agree to a definite term of employ- ment or for an indefinite term with a cause limitation on power to terminate, the reasonable assumption is that the parties intend any cause requirement to be undisputed or proven employee material breach, misconduct or malfea- sance, or inability to perform the work due to long-term disability; and do not intend also to permit termination based on the employer&#8217;s reasonable, good-faith but erroneous belief that there was cause for termination. This is in keeping with conventional views of cause as an objective concept. It is also consistent with the understanding that a good-faith but erroneous belief that early termination of a definite- term contract is justified, even if based on facts after an appropriate investiga- tion, is not legally sufficient cause to terminate such an agreement.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. X Corporation, eager to recruit E from E&#8217;s managerial posi- tion with a competitor in California to work at X&#8217;s facility in Florida, promises E in writing a four-year term of employment beginning with a $100,000 annual salary. E accepts the offer, moves to Florida, and be- gins working for X in Florida. Two years into the relationship, X an- nounces that because of a business downturn, it is closing the Florida facility and terminating E&#8217;s employ- ment. Absent a specific agreement conditioning the full four-year term of employment on X&#8217;s continuing its operations at the Florida facility, X is in breach of contract. X lacked cause for early termination of its obligations to E under the definite- term agreement absent E&#8217;s material breach, misconduct or malfeasance, or inability to perform the work due to long-term disability. The em- ployer&#8217;s changed economic circum- stances did not constitute cause for X&#8217;s early termination of E&#8217;s employ- ment.</p>

Absent evidence of an agreement to limit cause to terminate E&#8217;s em- ployment to the grounds stated in &#167; 2.04(a), X has a legally sufficient business reason for terminating the indefinite-term employment agree- ment and is not in breach of con- tract.</p>

X is in breach of contract if the trier of fact determines that E did not in fact engage in the claimed sexual harassment; even though X acted in good faith, X lacked cause for early termination of the agreement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 2.05 Binding Employer Policy Statements</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Policy statements by an employer in documents such as employee manu- als, personnel handbooks, and employment policy directives that are pro- vided or made accessible to employees, whether by physical or electronic means, and that, reasonably read in context, establish limits on the em- ployer&#8217;s power to terminate the employment relationship, are binding on the employer until modified or revoked (as provided in &#167; 2.06).</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope and cross-references.</i> As a general matter, employers of any size will make agreements (whether for a definite or indefinite term) that structure an employment relationship only with their higher-level employ- ees. When an employer is dealing with a large number of similarly situated employees, the employer is likely to communicate the terms of the employ- ment relationship through unilateral statements in documents such as em- ployee manuals, personnel handbooks, and employment policy directives that are provided, or made accessible, to employees. Such statements, reason- ably read in context, may limit the employer&#8217;s power to terminate the em- ployment relationship at will or may provide for other undertakings that are to apply uniformly to all similarly situated employees without further negotiation with individual employ- ees. Under certain circumstances, such statements may give rise to an employment agreement under tradi- tional contract principles. See &#167; 2.03. In other situations, such statements may reasonably induce detrimental re- liance under the promissory-estoppel doctrine. See &#167; 2.02(b). But even if the elements of an enforceable agreement or promise are not present, these uni- lateral policy statements can bind the employer until properly modified or re- voked. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Unilateral employer statements may also establish, or purport to es- tablish, employees&#8217; obligations to the employer. Statements filling out the duties expected of employees are gen- erally enforceable only by the employ- er&#8217;s power to terminate employment or administer discipline and do not pro- vide an independent basis for imposing liability on the employee. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Rationale.</i> Some courts have tried to fit this class of unilateral em- ployer statements into a conventional contract-law framework, reasoning that employees &#8220;accept&#8221; or &#8220;rely on&#8221; these unilateral employer &#8220;offers&#8221; by continuing to provide services after the statements are disseminated. This has proved to be a conceptually awkward fit. Employees are rarely made aware, and even more rarely make themselves aware, of the content of such statements when they first accept employment, or later when statements are changed. That is particularly true when the em- ployer does not provide the statements directly to employees but only to super- visors. Employees may only be able to read the statements in a personnel of- fice or in summaries forwarded to the employee&#8217;s paper or electronic-mail in- box. Such factual circumstances make it difficult to analogize this class of uni- lateral employer statements to unilat- eral-contract offers under the Restate- ment Second, Contracts &#167; 45, Comment <i>a</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Beyond that difficulty, traditional principles of consideration and bar- gained-for exchange rarely, if ever, apply when the employer&#8217;s unilateral statements are not made in response to a prospective employee&#8217;s expressed concerns or an employee&#8217;s threat to re- sign. For similar reasons reasonable detrimental reliance by employees on such statements under the promissoryestoppel <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>doctrine will be rare. More- over, many jurisdictions adopting the unilateral-contract approach do not follow traditional contract analysis by permitting employers to unilaterally modify or rescind promises contained in handbooks or personnel manuals even when there is no consideration for the change and the employee does not consent to the change other than by continuing to work under the new terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Against that background, other courts, and this Restatement, rest the binding effect of unilateral employer statements on general estoppel prin- ciples. Employers make certain uni- lateral statements about personnel policy to govern the operational deci- sions of their supervisors and manag- ers. Employers do so to serve their own interests in advancing productivity, improving employee morale, or achiev- ing some other organizational objec- tive. Absent contrary language in the statement, the employer&#8217;s purpose in promulgating a unilateral policy state- ment is to have it govern operational decisions while the statement is in ef- fect but not to bind the employer to continued adherence after changing the policy and giving reasonable no- tice to employees of the change. The courts reach this result in a number of ways: adjusting the unilateral-contract analysis to imply employees&#8217; &#8220;consent&#8221; to a new unilateral contract from the fact that employees continue to work under the new terms; allowing uni- lateral modification where employers have expressly reserved their right to change their unilateral policy state- ments; or invoking something akin to promissory-estoppel principles even in the absence of employee reliance or by conclusively presuming such reliance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">To avoid these analytical contor- tions, &#167; 2.05 provides a general rule that unilateral employer policy state- ments that are not enforceable agree- ments or promises under &#167; 2.02 may still be enforceable but can be modified only on a prospective basis. Such state- ments are analogous to rules of prac- tice promulgated by administrative agencies to govern their operational de- cisions. As a matter of administrative law, such rules bind the agency until properly modified or revoked on a theo- ry of &#8220;administrative agency estoppel,&#8221; even though no statute or regulation may have required their promulgation in the first place. Similarly, unilateral employer statements that, reasonably read in context, are intended to govern operational personnel decisions should be binding on the employer until prop- erly modified or revoked. Modification or revocation of such statements is the subject of &#167; 2.06.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Reasonably read in context.</i> Only certain unilateral employer policy statements are binding on the employ- er. It is often a question for the trier of fact whether a particular statement or set of statements, reasonably read in context, constitutes a binding policy statement. Several factors should in- form this inquiry. First, the presence of a prominent disclaimer in the text of the statement may indicate that it is a hortatory pronouncement rather than a statement intended to govern the employer&#8217;s operational personnel decisions. Any such disclaimer should be viewed, of course, in the context of the entire statement, other employer policies, and the employer&#8217;s course of conduct. Second, the mode of dissemi- nation may be relevant. Dissemination of a statement limited to supervisors, with no or limited access to the em- ployees, suggests it is intended only as guidance to supervisors in exercising their discretion rather than as a rule or policy governing the workplace. Third, a workplace culture relying on bilat- eral agreements with employees may reduce the significance of unilateral employer statements. Other factors may also be relevant to determining <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>whether a unilateral statement binds the employer.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Employer X Corporation promulgates an employee hand- book, distributed to all employees, containing a procedure that super- visors &#8220;should&#8221; follow before decid- ing to discharge an employee. The procedure includes a requirement of a prior warning, followed by an un- paid suspension from work for a re- peated offense, and then by a &#8220;last chance&#8221; agreement in the event of a third offense. If those steps fail to correct the problem, the proce- dure culminates in termination of employment for violating the last- chance agreement. The procedure is &#8220;not applicable&#8221; where the employ- ee has engaged in violence or theft, offenses for which immediate termi- nation is indicated. Employee E has been absent from work on several Mondays following vacation days or holidays. E has received a warning for this absenteeism but no other discipline. When E is once again absent on a Monday, X&#8217;s supervi- sor terminates E&#8217;s employment. Be- cause X promulgated the multistep disciplinary procedure in the hand- book to govern its supervisors&#8217; de- cisions on discipline for other than violence or theft, X has breached its contractual obligation to E.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Same facts as Illustration 1, except that the employee hand- book contains a prominent dis- claimer on the first page:</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8220;The statements contained in this handbook are not intended to create a contractual obligation of any kind. Employment at X Corpo- ration is at will.

<p class="comment_indent">All employees are required to sign an acknowledgment of receipt of the handbook, immediately be- low the disclaimer on the first page, which E had signed. In view of this disclaimer, X may not have breached any binding commitment to E. In some circumstances, de- spite this disclaimer, there may still be a question of fact as to whether X limited its power of termination by other language in the handbook or other statements or course of con- duct. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2.06 Modification or Revocation of Binding Employer Policy Statements</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) An employer may prospectively modify or revoke its binding pol- icy statements if it provides reasonable advance notice of, or reasonably makes accessible, the modified statement or revocation to the affected employees.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Modifications and revocations apply to all employees hired, and all employees who continue working, after the notice is given and the modification or revocation becomes effective.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Modifications and revocations cannot adversely affect vested or accrued employee rights that may have been created by the statement, an agreement based on the statement (covered by &#167; 2.03), or reasonable detrimental reliance on a promise in the statement (covered by &#167; 2.02, Comment c).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope and cross-references.</i> This Section deals with the issue of modification or revocation by employ- ers of commitments made in previ- ous unilateral statements. Absent an enforceable agreement under &#167; 2.03 or an employer promise inducing the employee&#8217;s detrimental reliance un- der &#167; 2.02, Comment <i>c</i>, and except for vested or accrued employee rights cre- ated by the statement, undertakings in unilateral statements do not bind the employer for all time. It is not reason- able to assume that an employer in- tended permanently to circumscribe its operational policies through such non- bargained-for promulgations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. The special case of vested or accrued employee rights.</i> An employer cannot by unilateral action modify or rescind employees&#8217; enforceable con- tractual rights. The terms &#8220;vested&#8221; or &#8220;accrued&#8221; are often used to indicate em- ployee rights that cannot be reduced, taken away, or otherwise adversely changed absent the employee&#8217;s con- sent, supported by consideration. &#8230; In appropriate circumstances, the em- ployer&#8217;s unilateral policy statement it- self may have created vested or accrued employee rights, which, under this Sec- tion, cannot be unilaterally modified or rescinded. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Modification or revocation.</i> This Section provides that, in general, undertakings in an employer&#8217;s policy statements are binding on the employ- er only from the date of distribution or a later-stated &#8220;effective date&#8221; until they are properly modified or revoked. Employment terminations that occur while the original statement is in place are governed by that statement; termi- nations that occur after modification takes effect are governed by the modi- fied statement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Effectiveness of modification or revocation.</i> A substantial number of courts have held that an employee who continues to work for the em- ployer after receiving proper notice of a modification or revocation of a unilat- eral employer statement that makes a personnel policy less advantageous to the employees than the original state- ment are deemed to have &#8220;accepted&#8221; the change. A smaller number of courts have held that a changed personnel policy covers only those incumbent em- ployees who have expressly agreed to the change. For these jurisdictions, it is not enough that an employee continues to work for the employer after receiving notice of the policy change.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This Restatement adopts the first position and rejects the second. A requirement that a modification or revocation of a unilateral employer statement can be made effective for incumbent employees only by a bilat- eral agreement is inconsistent with the basis for treating such statements as binding employer policy statements. That basis recognizes that the state- ments are self-imposed limitations on the employer&#8217;s authority binding as a matter of equitable estoppel rather than contract principles of consider- ation, bargained-for exchange, or even promissory estoppel. Requiring em- ployees expressly to agree to changes in employer statements would be un- workable for companies with large workforces and would lead to inconsis- tent treatment among similarly situ- ated employees. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2.07 Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(a) Each party to an employment relationship, including at-will em- ployment, owes a nonwaivable duty of good faith and fair dealing to each other party, which includes a party&#8217;s obligation not to hinder the other <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>party&#8217;s performance under, or to deprive the other party of the benefit of, their contractual relationship (&#167; 3.05(a)).</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The implied duty of good faith and fair dealing applies to at-will employment relationships in manner consistent with the essential nature of such an at-will relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) In any employment relationship, including at-will employment, the employer&#8217;s implied duty of good faith and fair dealing includes the duty not to terminate or seek to terminate the employment relationship for the purpose of:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) preventing the vesting or accrual of an employee right or ben- efit; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) retaliating against the employee for performing the employ- ee&#8217;s obligations under the employment contract or law.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Consistency with at-will con- tracts.</i> As in all contracts, the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing serves as a supplementary aid in im- plementing the parties&#8217; reasonable ex- pectations and should not be read as a means of overriding the basic terms of, or otherwise undermining the essential nature of, their contractual relation- ship. Jurisdictions that recognize the implied duty in the employment set- ting therefore also recognize that the duty applies to at-will employment in a manner consistent with the essential nature of such an at-will relationship&#8212;namely, except to the extent provided by law or public policy, either party may terminate the relationship with or without cause.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Application in at-will employ- ment: opportunistic firings.</i> This Sec- tion sets out two principal (though not necessarily exclusive) applications of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in the employment context. The first addresses an employer&#8217;s opportu- nistic use of its power to terminate the relationship as a means of preventing an employee right or benefit from vest- ing or accruing. &#8230; For example, if an employer provides a form of bonus tied to past performance but conditioned upon the employee&#8217;s remaining on the payroll as of a certain date, discharge of the employee without cause prior to that date for the purpose of prevent- ing vesting is a breach of the implied duty. The discharge will not be effec- tive to prevent the vesting of the em- ployee&#8217;s bonus. This is not because the employer has a general obligation not to terminate employees without cause. Rather, in the context of this bonus plan, the employer&#8217;s duty to cooperate means that once an employee has sub- stantially performed, unless there is independent cause for termination, the employer cannot use its right to termi- nate without cause for the purpose of depriving the employee of the benefit of the contract. The implied duty enforces the parties&#8217; reasonable expectations in agreeing to the deferred-compensation bonus arrangement by requiring full payment of the amount owed. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Application in at-will employ- ment: employer retaliation.</i> The second principal application of the implied duty in at-will employment involves re- taliatory discharge or other significant discipline of employees for performing their contractual or statutory duties. Although employers in at-will relation- ships are not required to have cause for termination of an employee, they are under an implied duty of cooperation that requires them not to terminate or <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>otherwise discipline an employee for performing the employee&#8217;s contractual obligations. Similarly, where employ- ees are under a legal duty to act or re- frain from acting in particular ways, employers violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by us- ing their at-will power to terminate or otherwise discipline employees for per- forming those legal obligations. In this context, a violation of the implied duty provides a basis for challenging the ter- mination or other discipline.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Nonwaivable duty.</i> The im- plied duty of good faith and fair dealing is read into every contract as a matter of law, and in that sense is not subject to modification or waiver by the par- ties&#8217; agreement. The agreement frames the employee&#8217;s job duties and the par- ties&#8217; reasonable expectations, and in- forms the extent to which the implied duty applies in particular cases.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. &#8230; E is X&#8217;s manager of product quality control who hears &#8220;through the grapevine&#8221; that X is engaged in accounting improprieties. E sends a statement to X&#8217;s president threat- ening &#8220;to go public&#8221; unless X ad- dresses those accounting issues. In retaliation for that conduct, X fires E. E cannot claim a violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing because the disclosure to X&#8217;s presi- dent was unrelated to E&#8217;s job duties; and E has no legal duty to issue the statement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 8.06 Enforcement of Restrictive Covenants in Employment Agreements</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Except as otherwise provided by other law or applicable professional rules, a covenant in an agreement between an employer and a former em- ployee restricting the former employee&#8217;s working activities is enforceable only if it is reasonably tailored in scope, geography, and time to further a protectable interest of the employer, as defined in &#167; 8.07, unless:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the employer discharges the employee on a basis that makes enforcement of the covenant inequitable;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the employer acted in bad faith in requiring or invoking the covenant;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the employer materially breached the underlying employment agreement; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) in the geographic region covered by the restriction, a great public need for the special skills and services of the former employee outweighs any legitimate interest of the employer in enforcing the cov- enant.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Types of restrictive covenants.</i> The rule stated in this Section applies to many different types of postemploy- ment restraints. So long as a restrictive covenant has the effect of substantially limiting employees from competing with their former employer, whether completely or in a specific manner, the agreement must meet the requirements of this Section to be enforceable. In ad- dition to noncompetition covenants, this Section also covers covenants that, rather than forbidding competition en- tirely, provide that certain competitive activity by a former employee will, for example, require specified payments <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>by the former employee to the former employer. This Section also applies to covenants that prohibit postemploy- ment solicitation of customers or so- licitation or hiring of coworkers with whom the employee came in contact while employed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Different types of restrictive cov- enants may be necessary to protect different types of employer interests, and courts should examine the as- serted business justification for each specific limitation. The same general inquiry, however, applies to all restric- tive covenants&#8212;namely, a court should determine whether the employer has a protectable interest, and whether the restrictive covenant is reasonably tai- lored to furthering that interest. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Reasonably tailored.</i> A court will enforce a restrictive covenant only if it is reasonably tailored to the protec- tion of a legitimate interest of the em- ployer as set forth in &#167; 8.07. To be rea- sonably tailored, the covenant should be no more restrictive in duration, scope of activities, or geography than necessary to protect the legitimate in- terest at stake. Whether limitations are reasonable will vary depending on the circumstances of the case, includ- ing industry practices and the nature of the interest justifying the restric- tive covenant. When confronted with a blanket contractual restriction on all competition&#8212;even if the restriction otherwise is of reasonable duration and geographical scope&#8212;courts will inquire whether the employer&#8217;s legitimate in- terest could not be equally well served by a narrower restriction. For example, could the employer&#8217;s interest in pro- tecting customer relationships be sat- isfied by a reasonable nonsolicitation clause instead of a noncompete clause? In some circumstances, however, such as when it is especially difficult for an employer to determine whether a former employee is soliciting its cus- tomers, a nonsolicitation clause may not adequately protect the employer&#8217;s legitimate interests. Regardless of the nature of an employer&#8217;s interest, the employer may not restrict employees from working in any market in which the employer does not do business.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The inquiry into the reasonableness of geographic, temporal, and scope-of- business limitations in restrictive cove- nants is context-sensitive and depends heavily on the nature of the legitimate interests at stake. Identical limitations will be reasonable to protect some in- terests but not others. A provision com- pensating the former employee during the term of the restrictive covenant (sometimes called &#8220;garden leave&#8221;) may be a factor in favor of finding the re- striction reasonable.</p>

A narrower agreement, such as one prohibiting E from soliciting the customers whom E had serviced while working for X, would be suf- ficient to protect X&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. E, a vice president of computer-data-storage company X, agrees not to compete with X any- where in the world for six months. Both X and its competitors serve customers worldwide, and E has had extensive access to X&#8217;s trade secrets, which apply worldwide. Because E&#8217;s trade secrets have worldwide utility, the worldwide restriction is reasonably tailored to further a protectable interest of X. &#8230;</p>

Restrictive covenants agreed to after the start of the employment re- lationship.</i> The majority rule is that continuing employment of an at-will employee is sufficient consideration to support the enforcement of an other- wise valid restrictive covenant. How- ever, a significant minority of juris- dictions require &#8220;new&#8221; or &#8220;additional&#8221; consideration. Under either approach, the parties may enter into enforceable restrictive covenants after the start of an employment relationship. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Terminated employees.</i> Rea- sonable restrictive covenants are gen- erally enforceable against employees who have been discharged for cause. An opposite rule would have the perverse consequence of providing an incentive for an employee who wants relief from the restrictions of a reasonable cove- nant to perform badly and thus trigger a for-cause termination.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In contrast, restrictive covenants are generally unenforceable against employees who are terminated with- out cause or who quit employment for cause attributable to the employer (defined in the same way as cause for the termination of fixed-term agree- ments in &#167; 2.04(a)). An opposite rule would have the perverse consequence of enabling an employer to terminate rather than retain an employee who is performing satisfactorily and then restrict the discharged employee&#8217;s abil- ity to secure new employment. By the same token, an employer should not be able to obtain enforcement of a restric- tive covenant when the employer acts in bad faith, such as by securing the employee&#8217;s execution of the covenant after planning to discharge the em- ployee. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Employer&#8217;s material breach of employment agreement.</i> If the employer materially breaches the employment agreement, it cannot enforce an oth- erwise valid restrictive covenant con- tained in the agreement. &#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 8.07 Protectable Interests for Restrictive Covenants</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A restrictive covenant is enforceable only if the employer can demonstrate that the covenant furthers a legitimate interest of the em- ployer.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) An employer has a legitimate interest in protecting, by means of a reasonably tailored restrictive covenant with its employee, the em- ployer&#8217;s:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) trade secrets, as defined in &#167; 8.02, and other protectable confi- dential information that does not meet the definition of trade secret;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) customer relationships;</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) investment in the employee&#8217;s reputation in the market; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) purchase of a business owned by the employee.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Confidential information.</i> An employer&#8217;s interest in protecting its trade secrets and other confidential information can justify a reasonable restrictive covenant. In general, most nonpublic information in which an em- ployer has a protectable interest will be protectable as a trade secret &#8230; How- ever, an employer may occasionally seek protection through contract of ad- ditional non-trade-secret information, often termed &#8220;confidential&#8221; or &#8220;propri- etary,&#8221; which is similarly nonpublic. Such arrangements may be in the form of noncompete agreements, whereby <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the employee is effectively barred from disclosing confidential information by not being able to take up employment with a competitor that will require disclosure of such information; or in the form of nondisclosure agreements, whereby the employer can seek dam- ages or injunctive relief in the event of disclosure or imminent disclosure of the information covered by the agree- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The determination of whether infor- mation is protectable as confidential or proprietary is inherently fact-specific, as it often turns on the language of the covenant at issue, the nature of the information to be protected, and the degree to which disclosure would un- fairly benefit a competitor. Courts will generally protect nonpublic commer- cial information that provides a clear economic advantage to the employer by virtue of its confidentiality, provided that the restrictive covenant is other- wise reasonable under &#167; 8.06 and the information has been treated as confi- dential by the employer. A justification for enforcing reasonable nondisclosure agreements that go beyond trade-secret protection is that the employee accused of violating the restrictive covenant was put on notice of which information the employer considered confidential and proprietary. An employer cannot protect as confidential any information in which it does not have a protectable interest, such as information that has entered the public domain and infor- mation that would be considered part of the general experience, knowledge, training, and skills that an employ- ee acquires in the course of employ- ment. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Customer relationships.</i> An employer often makes significant in- vestments to foster relationships be- tween its customers and its sales force and other employees. An employer has a legitimate interest in taking reason- able measures to protect that invest- ment by barring employees from ap- propriating customer relationships that the employer created and fostered by investing its resources. Because a covenant prohibiting former employ- ees from soliciting customers with whom they dealt while employed will ordinarily fully protect this legitimate interest, a broader restriction barring all competition by former employees or- dinarily is not enforceable. The length of time that employees worked for their employer is often relevant in determin- ing the reasonableness of a restriction claimed to be necessary to preserve the former employer&#8217;s customer relation- ships. For example, employees should not be bound by a broad restrictive cov- enant if they have worked for too short a time to have made use of or benefited from the type of customer relationships the employer would have a legitimate interest in protecting. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Insufficient employer interests.</i> An employer may have many economic reasons to attempt to restrict what its employees can do after termination of their employment. However, unless the employer can demonstrate a pro- tectable interest under this Section, these reasons, standing alone, will not support an otherwise reasonable re- strictive covenant because they are not sufficiently weighty to justify the social and individual costs inherent in re- strictions on competition. For example, an interest in recouping investments in the training of employees may jus- tify repayment obligations but would not justify a restriction on competition. Similarly, the desire of an employer to retain its talented, trained, or experi- enced employees is not an interest that can legitimately support a restrictive covenant. Finally, an employer&#8217;s un- derstandable wish to prevent compe- tition by former employees is not, by itself, a protectable interest under this Section.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 8.08 Modification of Unreasonable Restrictive Covenant</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A court may delete or modify provisions in an overbroad restrictive cov- enant in an employment agreement and then enforce the covenant as modified unless the agreement does not allow for modification or the em- ployer lacked a reasonable and good-faith basis for believing the covenant was enforceable. Lack of a reasonable and good-faith basis for believing a covenant was enforceable may be manifested by its gross overbreadth alone, or by overbreadth coupled with other evidence that the employer sought to do more than protect its legitimate interests.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope and cross-references.</i> Although unreasonable restrictive covenants should never be enforced as written, a court may modify an overly broad restrictive covenant into one that is reasonably tailored to the employer&#8217;s protectable interest under &#167; 8.07, and may thereafter enforce the modified covenant. Such modification, sometimes called &#8220;blue penciling,&#8221; lies within the sound discretion of the court but that discretion should be exercised with care so as not to create an incen- tive for employers to draft overbroad restrictive covenants that in some in- stances will be taken by employees at face value as enforceable. On the other hand, a rule that forbids judicial modi- fication and leaves courts with only a binary &#8220;enforce or reject&#8221; choice can also lead over time to a legal regime that provides employers with an incen- tive to draft overly broad covenants that employees will similarly regard as enforceable, due to judicial unwill- ingness to completely reject a covenant that is partially valid. For example, a court faced with a seven-month restric- tion when it thinks a six-month restric- tion is reasonable might uphold the greater restriction rather than strike it down completely. This would create a precedent that seven months is reason- able to which future employers might gravitate. The best approach, reflected in this Section, is for courts to refuse to modify an overly broad restrictive covenant when the employer lacked a reasonable good-faith belief that the covenant was enforceable. In some cases, lack of good faith can be shown by the covenant itself being so clearly overbroad that no reasonable employer would have believed it was reasonably tailored to protect the employer&#8217;s legiti- mate interests. Other cases might re- quire additional evidence of bad faith. Once overbreadth has been shown, the employer has the burden of demon- strating good faith in order to justify a modification.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Overbreadth.</i> To be enforce- able, a restrictive covenant must be based on a protectable interest under &#167; 8.07 and be reasonable in scope at the time of contracting and at the time of enforcement. A restrictive covenant that is either obtained in bad faith or objectively unreasonable at the time of contracting is unenforceable. Also, a change in circumstances between time of contracting and time of enforcement may in some cases so erode the employ- er&#8217;s protectable interest as to render the covenant unenforceable. &#8230;</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Termination of employment.</i> For purposes of this Chapter, the phrase &#8220;termination of employment&#8221; includes not only express terminations effected by the employer, but also &#8220;con- structive terminations&#8221;. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Agreement for a definite or indefinite term.</i> The terminology here tracks that used in Chapter 2. An agreement between an employer and an employee is binding on both parties unless mutually rescinded or modified. It requires consideration or bargained- for exchange under the usual rules of contract formation &#8230; An agreement can provide for a definite term of em- ployment whereby earlier termina- tion of the agreement absent cause is a breach of contract (&#167; 2.03(a)(1)), or for an indefinite term requiring cause for termination so that a termination without cause is a breach (&#167; 2.03(a)(2)), or for an indefinite term with no limit on termination (&#167; 2.01) except perhaps notice or a stipulated payment by the employer (&#167; 9.01(c)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Those jurisdictions that treat wrongful termination in violation of public policy as a contractual cause of action would look to &#167; 9.01(b) for the measure of damages. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Would have received under the remaining term of the definite-term agreement.</i> If the employer lacks cause to terminate a definite-term agree- ment, the usual remedy reflects the likelihood that employment would have continued for at least the stated term of the agreement. Even if there is some chance the employee might not have worked for the full term, the employ- er&#8217;s termination without cause created that uncertainty. Courts generally al- low the discharged employee to recover for the balance of the stated term, less income that was earned or should have been earned elsewhere (see Comment <i>f</i> below). Absent explicit language in the agreement, &#8220;cause&#8221; in a definite-term agreement does not include changes in the economic condition of the employer (&#167; 2.04(a)). If the term of an oral em- ployment contract exceeds one year, the agreement is likely to be unenforce- able for lack of a writing under the ap- plicable statute of frauds. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Would have received under the indefinite-term agreement.</i> Unless otherwise agreed, the term &#8220;cause&#8221; in an indefinite-term agreement has a broader scope than in a definite-term agreement and includes significant changes in the economic condition of the employer (&#167; 2.04(b)). When the em- ployer&#8217;s discharge of the employee is without cause, determining what com- pensation the employee would have re- ceived under the agreement but for the employer&#8217;s breach is necessarily a dif- ficult inquiry. Both in cases governed by statute and by decisional law, the courts increasingly have allowed the issue of whether the proof establishes reasonably certain lost future income to go to the trier of fact under guide- lines that place boundaries on the cal- culation. See &#167; 9.05, Comment <i>e</i>. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Mitigation of losses or avoid- able losses.</i> Recovery for breach of any contractual obligation is limited to dam- ages that could not have been &#8220;avoided without undue risk, burden or humili- ation.&#8221; Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 350(1). But the injured party is &#8220;not precluded from recovery &#8230; to the ex- tent that he has made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to avoid loss.&#8221; Id. &#167; 350(2). This is the rule of avoidable consequences, also known as the duty to mitigate damages. And of course the employee cannot recover for losses that actually are avoided, most commonly by accepting alternative employment. See generally id. &#167;&#167; 347, 349. What the employee actually earns in alternative employment will often be the best mea- sure of what the employee could have earned through reasonable effort. If ac- tual earnings fall short of what reason- ably could have been earned, the latter <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>would constitute reasonable avoidance of losses under this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Reasonable mitigation is not a &#8220;duty&#8221; in the sense that the employee is subject to liability for failure to miti- gate. But the phrase is in common use, and &#8220;mitigation&#8221; and &#8220;avoidable losses&#8221; will be used interchangeably in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In employment cases, absent provi- sion to the contrary in the applicable law, the employer has the burden of persuasion on failure to mitigate. The employer must show the employee failed to make reasonable efforts to mitigate losses and that such efforts would have succeeded. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8220;Collateral source&#8221; income from pri- vate or social insurance is generally not deducted from damages.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A is a famous cinema ac- tress known for her singing, danc- ing, and musical comedy. Despite an agreement to employ her as the female lead in &#8220;Bloomer Girl,&#8221; a motion-picture musical to be filmed in California where A lives and to pay her a guaranteed compensation of $100,000 a week for 10 weeks commencing January 1, 2013 for a total of $1,000,000, her producer X has decided not to produce &#8220;Bloom- er Girl.&#8221; Instead, X has offered A the female lead in &#8220;Big Country,&#8221; a western movie, to be filmed in Aus- tralia. A would receive the same compensation for working in &#8220;Big Country,&#8221; plus first-class travel and lodging accommodations. A declines the offer and sues X for the guar- anteed compensation. A&#8217;s require- ment to reasonably mitigate losses does not require her to accept the &#8220;Big Country&#8221; offer. In the circum- stances of this case, considering the reputational costs to A in appearing in a different type of motion picture for which she was not known and which required work in a different part of the world, the &#8220;Big Country&#8221; film did not constitute comparable alternative employment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. B, a well-known stunt man used in motion-picture musicals and dramas, entered into an agreement with producer X to provide stunt- man services for the male lead in &#8220;Bloomer Girl&#8221; for a guaranteed compensation of $5000 per week for 10 weeks commencing January 1, 2013 for a total compensation of $50,000. When X decides not to produce &#8220;Bloomer Girl,&#8221; he offers B employment (at the same compen- sation and to commence in the same time frame) in a western movie, &#8220;Midday Noon,&#8221; to be produced in California. B declines the offer and does not engage in other efforts to obtain comparable employment. B has not reasonably mitigated his damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Reasonable mitigation over time.</i> When the discharged employee does not promptly obtain a compa- rable position after the termination, what constitutes reasonable mitigation changes over time. Soon after termina- tion, and for a reasonable period there- after, it is reasonable for the employee to seek only work involving comparable skill and working conditions. If the em- ployee is unsuccessful in this pursuit, at some point it becomes reasonable to take similar work that is available, even if not as desirable as the previ- ous employment. The decisions on this point outside of a statutory context are few but as courts have become more re- ceptive to claims of reasonably certain future economic loss, see Comment <i>e</i>, courts should evaluate the reasonable- ness of mitigation efforts over time. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Promissory estoppel.</i> Subsec- tion (d) deals with employer promises to limit termination of employment that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by the promisee-employee. Such promises <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>are enforceable under the Restate- ment Second, Contracts &#167; 90(1). &#8220;The remedy granted for breach&#8221; of such promises &#8220;may be limited as justice requires.&#8221; Id. The fundamental ques- tion is what the employer promised the employee or prospective employee. If the employer promised employment that could not be terminated except for cause and the employee reasonably relies to the employee&#8217;s detriment on such a promise, the affected employee has a reliance-based claim for damages against the employer that is similar in scope and nature to a breach-of- contract claim under subsection (b). If, however, the employer promised the employee or prospective employee em- ployment that, however attractive the compensation and other terms, would be terminable without cause, and the employee reasonably relies to his det- riment on such a promise, the affected employee has a claim only for limited reliance damages, such as relocation costs, because no particular period of employment with the employer was promised. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>j. Noneconomic damages.</i> Dam- ages for reputational harm and for emotional distress are generally not recoverable for breach of contract. Un- der &#167; 353 of the Restatement Second, Contracts, &#8220;[r]ecovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result.&#8221; See id. &#167; 353, Comment <i>a</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>k. Consequential damages. &#8230;</i> Losses that would otherwise be un- foreseeable may become foreseeable and recoverable if the employer knows about these potential losses before en- tering into the employment agreement. Damages that stem from loss of income during the period between termination and the recovery of damages are gen- erally not recoverable as consequential damages but, rather, are considered covered by interest on the judgment (and any prejudgment interest avail- able under applicable law).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>l. Reasonable mitigation expens- es.</i> Reasonable mitigation expenses (whether successful or unsuccessful), such as retaining the services of a placement agency, are recoverable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>m. Restitutionary relief.</i> Resti- tutionary relief &#8220;off the contract&#8221; may be available in certain circumstances. Under &#167; 31 of the Restatement Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, &#8220;[a] person who renders performance under an agreement that cannot be en- forced against the recipient by reason of (a) indefiniteness, or (b) the failure to satisfy an extrinsic requirement of enforceability such as the Statute of Frauds, has a claim in restitution against the recipient as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment.&#8221; For in- stance, if an employee is discharged in violation of an oral agreement that is not enforceable for lack of a writing under the applicable statute of frauds, the employee may recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of ser- vices rendered.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Binding employer policy state- ments.</i> The terminology here tracks &#167; 2.05, which provides that unilateral employer policy statements can be binding on employers while the state- ment remains in effect. The measure of damages stated here and in &#167; 9.01(b) also applies in cases of discharge in violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or any other contract doctrine that limits the em- ployer&#8217;s right to terminate employment (&#167; 2.02).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Would have received under that policy statement.</i> Under &#167; 2.06, the employer&#8217;s obligation under a binding employer policy statement is generally limited to the period the policy remains in effect. If, however, the policy state- ment creates a nonmodifiable or vested term that cannot be adversely changed without the employee&#8217;s agreement, supported by consideration, and that term limits the employer&#8217;s power to terminate employment without cause, the measure of damages would be the same as under &#167; 9.01(b). If that term creates an entitlement to compensa- tion or benefits only, the measure of damages is treated in &#167; 9.03.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 9.04 Injunctive Relief&#8212;Employer Breach</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, an employer&#8217;s agreement, promise, or statement that it will hire or continue to employ an employee or job applicant will not be specifically enforced.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) An employee may obtain injunctive relief to enforce any other term of an employment agreement (&#167; 2.03), binding employer promise (&#167; 2.02, Comment c), or binding employer policy statement (&#167; 2.05) if the employee satisfies the traditional requirements for equitable relief.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Specific performance.</i> It is a longstanding rule of equity that spe- cific performance of promises to work (&#167; 9.08) or to provide employment will not be granted. See Restatement Sec- ond, Contracts &#167; 367(1) (&#8220;A promise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced.&#8221;). &#8230; The rule seeks to protect employees from per- forming compelled services, to protect employers from having to bring back unwanted employees into their organi- zation, and to protect courts from the burden of enforcing and supervising the performance of affirmative duties in a continuing relationship already badly strained by the litigation and the dispute that led to it. The first purpose explains why employers cannot obtain such decrees; the second and third pur- poses explain why neither party can.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">What equity will do, provided the traditional requirements stated in sub- section (b) are met, is enforce positive decrees that do not require unduly bur- densome judicial supervision (e.g., &#8220;pay the compensation owed&#8221;) or negative decrees that require a party (usually the employee) to refrain from taking an action (e.g., &#8220;do not work for any com- petitor&#8221;).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>c. Except as otherwise provided by law.</i> Employment statutes often provide as a presumptive remedy re- instatement of employees to positions the employees held before their em- ployment was unlawfully terminated (or instatement to positions that were unlawfully denied to them). &#8230; Some- times reinstatement is not desired by the affected employee or is impracti- cal; in such cases, courts under vari- ous statutes have interpreted their authority to award equitable relief to include a &#8220;front pay&#8221; remedy in lieu of reinstatement. In cases governed by common law, however, the courts as a general matter have not awarded rein- statement as a remedy. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(a) An employee who breaches any obligation that the employment agreement clearly states is a basis for damages liability is subject to li- ability for that breach of contract. The employer may recover damages for foreseeable economic loss that the employer could not have reasonably avoided, including any reasonably foreseeable consequential damages and the expenses of reasonable efforts to mitigate damages.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Economic loss under subsection (a) does not include lost profits caused by the employee&#8217;s breach unless the agreement expressly provides for such recovery or the employee knew or should have known that the employee would be held responsible for lost profits caused by the employ- ee&#8217;s breach. (For employees who have breached a tort-based or fiduciary duty to the employer, see &#167; 9.09(b).)</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment: &#8230;</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Basis for damages liability or actionable obligation.</i> As a general matter, an employee&#8217;s failure to meet the employee&#8217;s contractual obligations to an employer is not redressable in an action for damages. In all employ- ment relationships, the basic exchange is compensation and benefits to be paid the employee in return for the em- ployee&#8217;s competent, satisfactory perfor- mance of the requirements of the posi- tion. Unless otherwise agreed, if the employee performs poorly in the posi- tion, the employer&#8217;s usual recourse is to terminate the employment relation- ship or implement discipline short of dismissal. Even when the employment relationship can be terminated only for cause, demonstrated poor performance constitutes cause for termination (see &#167; 2.04).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Recognizing this background under- standing of the parties to employment relationships, subsection (a) provides that absent language in the agreement that makes it clear that the parties in- tend what might be termed an &#8220;action- able obligation&#8221;&#8212;that is, an obligation the breach of which could result in employee liability for damages&#8212;em- ployers do not have a cause of action for damages against an employee who breaches his or her contractual obliga- tion to provide competent, satisfactory services. &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">(a) An employer may not obtain specific performance of the employ- ee&#8217;s promise to work.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) An employer may obtain injunctive relief to enforce any other ob- ligation expressly stated in the employment agreement if the employer satisfies the traditional requirements for obtaining equitable relief.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope and cross-references.</i> This Section deals with injunctive re- lief against an employee&#8217;s breach of contract. It is a longstanding rule of eq- uity that courts will not grant specific performance of agreements or promis- es to work or provide employment (see &#167; 9.04, Comment <i>b</i>). See Restatement Second, Contracts &#167; 367(1) (&#8220;A prom- ise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced.&#8221;). This rule is supported not only by the difficulty courts would face monitoring compli- ance with a decree mandating the provision of services, but more funda- mentally by the employee&#8217;s generally protected interest in not being forced to provide services against the employee&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Injunctions to enforce other contractual obligations.</i> Injunctive relief is available in appropriate cir- cumstances to restrain an employee from violating express or implied con- tractual obligations. This includes em- ployees who are under an implied con- tractual duty of loyalty under &#167; 8.01(a) or employees who have entered into reasonable restrictive covenants (&#167;&#167; 8.06&#8211;8.08). &#8230; Recitals in agree- ments stipulating satisfaction of such requirements are given weight but are not determinative of whether the court should issue an injunction. &#8230;</p>

<p class="chap-subtitle"><b>(ARTICLES 1 AND 2)</b></p>

<p class="head1"><b>COMPILERS&#8217; NOTE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a joint project of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (also known as the Uniform Law Commission) and the American Law Institute, was origi- nally promulgated in 1951 and has been amended a number of times in succeeding years. By the 1960s, it had been enacted in every state (al- though some Articles, including Article 2, were not enacted in Louisiana). Topics covered include sales of goods (Article 2), leases of goods (Article 2A), negotiable instruments (Article 3), bank deposits and collections (Ar- ticle 4), funds transfers, (Article 4A), letters of credit (Article 5), docu- ments of title (Article 7), investment securities (Article 8), and secured transactions (Article 9). In addition, Article 1 contains general provisions (including extensive definitions) that apply to all transactions within the scope of the UCC. Another Article (Article 6) dealt with bulk sales, but this Article has been repealed in all but a few states.</p>
<p class="indent">For purposes of the law of contracts, the two most important Articles of the UCC are Articles 1 and 2, the former containing general provisions that apply to all transactions within the scope of the UCC and the latter governing sales of goods. Both Articles were widely enacted by the 1960s (Article 1 was enacted in every state and Article 2 was enacted in every state except Louisiana), and remained quite stable for four decades, with the only amendments being minor changes to conform to revisions to oth- er Articles. More recently, though, both Articles have been the subject of much change. In 2001, a revised text of Article 1 was promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute, and in 2003 those organizations promulgated substantial amendments to Article 2 and a revised version of Article 7 that include further revisions to some definitional provisions in Article 1. As of the publication of this volume, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had enacted the current ver- sion of Article 1 (i.e., through the 2003 amendments). In contrast to this successful modernization process, however, no states enacted the 2003 amendments to Article 2, and they were withdrawn in 2011.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, in 2019, the Uniform Law Commission and The Amer- ican Law Institute appointed a joint committee to consider whether changes to the UCC were advisable to accommodate emerging technolo- gies, such as artificial intelligence, distributed ledger technology, and vir- tual currency. The committee, initially formed as a study committee and <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>subsequently constituted as a drafting committee, held 18 meetings from October 2019 to March 2022 and ultimately produced a package of sig- nificant amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code, which were ad- opted by the American Law Institute and the Uniform Law Commission in 2022. The amendments are wide-ranging, covering digital assets (con- trollable electronic records), electronic money, chattel paper, &#8220;bundled&#8221; or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; transactions (consisting of the sale or lease of goods together with the sale, lease, or licensing of other property and the provision of services as an integrated transaction), documents of title, payment sys- tems, miscellaneous UCC amendments, and consumer issues. Many of the amendments are to provisions in Articles 1 and 2 that are of relevance to a course in Contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">While it is expected that the 2022 amendments will be widely enacted within a few years, only a handful of states had enacted them by the pub- lication deadline of this volume (May 22, 2023). Accordingly, this volume presents provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code both as they exist in the majority of states today (i.e., before giving effect to the 2022 amend- ments) and as amended. For most changes brought about by the 2022 amendments, the amended version of a provision appears <i>in italics</i> im- mediately following the previous version. When amendments relate only to a word or phrase, however, sometimes the effect of the amendment is indicated in a footnote.</p>
<p class="indent">Because Article 1 contains a number of provisions (including defini- tions) that are not relevant to Article 2 or contract law, the presentation of Article 1 in this volume is abridged by the omission of those provisions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sections of the Uniform Commercial Code are typically accompanied by &#8220;Official Comments&#8221; supplied by the drafters. These Comments, al- though not enacted by the legislature, have proven to be quite helpful and are often cited by judges. This volume contains a selection of those Comments.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comments</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Source:</b> Former Section 1&#8211;102 (1)&#8211;(2); Former Section 1&#8211;103.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> This sec- tion is derived from subsections (1) and (2) of former Section 1&#8211;102 and from former Section 1&#8211;103. Subsection (a) of this section combines subsections (1) and (2) of former Section 1&#8211;102. Ex- cept for changing the form of reference to the Uniform Commercial Code and minor stylistic changes, its language is the same as subsections (1) and (2) of former Section 1&#8211;102. Except for changing the form of reference to the Uniform Commercial Code and minor stylistic changes, subsection (b) of this section is identical to former Section 1&#8211;103. The provisions have been com- bined in this section to reflect the inter- relationship between them.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The Uniform Commercial Code is drawn to provide flexibility so that, since it is intended to be a semi- permanent and infrequently-amended piece of legislation, it will provide its own machinery for expansion of com- mercial practices. It is intended to make it possible for the law embodied in the Uniform Commercial Code to be applied by the courts in the light of unforeseen and new circumstances and practices. The proper construction <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the Uniform Commercial Code re- quires, of course, that its interpretation and application be limited to its reason.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Even prior to the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, courts were careful to keep broad acts from being hampered in their effects by later acts of limited scope. See Pacific Wool Growers v. Draper &amp; Co., 158 Or. 1, 73 P.2d 1391 (1937), and compare Section 1&#8211;104. The courts have often recog- nized that the policies embodied in an act are applicable in reason to subject- matter that was not expressly included in the language of the act, Commercial Nat. Bank of New Orleans v. Canal- Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co., 239 U.S. 520, 36 S.Ct. 194, 60 L.Ed. 417 (1916) (bona fide purchase policy of Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act extended to case not covered but of equivalent na- ture), and did the same where reason and policy so required, even where the subject-matter had been intention- ally excluded from the act in general. Agar v. Orda, 264 N.Y. 248, 190 N.E. 479 (1934) (Uniform Sales Act change in seller&#8217;s remedies applied to contract for sale of choses in action even though the general coverage of that Act was in- tentionally limited to goods &#8220;other than things in action.&#8221;) They implemented a statutory policy with liberal and use- ful remedies not provided in the statu- tory text. They disregarded a statutory limitation of remedy where the reason of the limitation did not apply. Fiter- man v. J. N. Johnson &amp; Co., 156 Minn. 201, 194 N.W. 399 (1923) (requirement of return of the goods as a condition to rescission for breach of warranty; also, partial rescission allowed). Nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code stands in the way of the continuance of such action by the courts.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The Uniform Commercial Code should be construed in accordance with its underlying purposes and policies. The text of each section should be read in the light of the purpose and policy of the rule or principle in question, as also of the Uniform Commercial Code as a whole, and the application of the language should be construed narrowly or broadly, as the case may be, in con- formity with the purposes and policies involved.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. <b>Applicability of supple- mental principles of law.</b> Subsection (b) states the basic relationship of the Uniform Commercial Code to supple- mental bodies of law. The Uniform Commercial Code was drafted against the backdrop of existing bodies of law, including the common law and equity, and relies on those bodies of law to supplement it provisions in many im- portant ways. At the same time, the Uniform Commercial Code is the pri- mary source of commercial law rules in areas that it governs, and its rules represent choices made by its drafters and the enacting legislatures about the appropriate policies to be furthered in the transactions it covers. Therefore, while principles of common law and eq- uity may supplement provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, they may not be used to supplant its provisions, or the purposes and policies those pro- visions reflect, unless a specific provi- sion of the Uniform Commercial Code provides otherwise. In the absence of such a provision, the Uniform Com- mercial Code preempts principles of common law and equity that are incon- sistent with either its provisions or its purposes and policies.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The language of subsection (b) is intended to reflect both the concept of supplementation and the concept of preemption. Some courts, however, had difficulty in applying the identical language of former Section 1&#8211;103 to de- termine when other law appropriately may be applied to supplement the Uni- form Commercial Code, and when that law has been displaced by the Code. Some decisions applied other law in situations in which that application, while not inconsistent with the text of any particular provision of the Uniform <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Commercial Code, clearly was inconsis- tent with the underlying purposes and policies reflected in the relevant provi- sions of the Code. See, e.g., Sheerbon- net, Ltd. v. American Express Bank, Ltd., 951 F. Supp. 403 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). In part, this difficulty arose from Com- ment 1 to former Section 1&#8211;103, which stated that &#8220;this section indicates the continued applicability to commercial contracts of all supplemental bodies of law except insofar as they are explicitly displaced by this Act.&#8221; The &#8220;explicitly displaced&#8221; language of that Comment did not accurately reflect the proper scope of Uniform Commercial Code preemption, which extends to displace- ment of other law that is inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as with its text.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The supplemental principles of law and equity to which subsection (b) re- fers may evolve over time to take into account developments in technology. These developments may include, for example, developing case law on con- tract formation in an electronic en- vironment and the use of automated transactions and arrangements that are sometimes referred to as &#8220;elec- tronic agents&#8221; (which may or may not actually reflect or create agency rela- tionships under the applicable law of agency). See generally Uniform Elec- tronic Transactions Act (UETA); Re- statement (Third) of Agency &#167; 1.04, Reporter&#8217;s Note to Comment e (2006) (discussing the relationship between &#8220;electronic agents&#8221; and the law of prin- cipal and agent). The supplementation recognized by subsection (b) should re- flect this evolution.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. <b>Application of subsection (b) to statutes.</b> The primary focus of Section 1&#8211;103 is on the relationship be- tween the Uniform Commercial Code and principles of common law and eq- uity as developed by the courts. State law, however, increasingly is statutory. Not only are there a growing number of state statutes addressing specific issues that come within the scope of the Uniform Commercial Code, but in some States many general principles of common law and equity have been codified. When the other law relat- ing to a matter within the scope of the Uniform Commercial Code is a statute, the principles of subsection (b) remain relevant to the court&#8217;s analysis of the relationship between that statute and the Uniform Commercial Code, but other principles of statutory interpre- tation that specifically address the in- terrelationship between statutes will be relevant as well. In some situations, the principles of subsection (b) still will be determinative. For example, the mere fact that an equitable principle is stated in statutory form rather than in judicial decisions should not change the court&#8217;s analysis of whether the principle can be used to supplement the Uniform Commercial Code&#8212;un- der subsection (b), equitable principles may supplement provisions of the Uni- form Commercial Code only if they are consistent with the purposes and poli- cies of the Uniform Commercial Code as well as its text. In other situations, however, other interpretive principles addressing the interrelationship be- tween statutes may lead the court to conclude that the other statute is con- trolling, even though it conflicts with the Uniform Commercial Code. This, for example, would be the result in a situation where the other statute was specifically intended to provide addi- tional protection to a class of individu- als engaging in transactions covered by the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Listing not exclusive.</b> The list of sources of supplemental law in subsection (b) is intended to be merely illustrative of the other law that may supplement the Uniform Commercial Code, and is not exclusive. No listing could be exhaustive. Further, the fact that a particular section of the Uniform Commercial Code makes express reference <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to other law is not intended to suggest the negation of the general ap- plication of the principles of subsection (b). Note also that the word &#8220;bankrupt- cy&#8221; in subsection (b), continuing the use of that word from former Section 1&#8211;103, should be understood not as a specific reference to federal bankruptcy law but, rather as a reference to gen- eral principles of insolvency, whether under federal or state law.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">10. &#8220;Conspicuous.&#8221; &#8230; This definition states the general standard that to be conspicuous a term ought to be no- ticed by a reasonable person. Whether a term is conspicuous is an issue for the court. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) set out several methods for making a term conspicuous. Requiring that a term be conspicuous blends a notice function (the term ought to be noticed) and a planning function (giving guidance to the party relying on the term regard- ing how that result can be achieved). <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Although these paragraphs indicate some of the methods for making a term attention-calling, the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it. The statutory language should not be construed to permit a re- sult that is inconsistent with that test.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>As amended in 2022:</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. &#8220;Conspicuous.&#8221; Derived from former Section 1&#8211;201(10). This defini- tion states the general standard that to be conspicuous a term ought to be noticed by a reasonable person against which the term is to operate. Whether a term is conspicuous is an issue for the court. Whether the appearance and pre- sentation of a particular term satisfy this standard is determined by refer- ence to the totality of the circumstances and requires a case-by-case analysis.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>Historically, contract terms were presented in writing, making the use of standards that relate to the size and appearance of type relevant to the de- termination of conspicuousness. Today terms in a record are frequently com- municated electronically. New tech- nologies have created opportunities for terms to be displayed or presented in novel ways, such as by the use of pop- up windows, text balloons, dynamically expanding or dynamically magnifying text, and non-visual elements such as vibrations, to name a few.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>The definition has been revised in the Uniform Commercial Code Amend- ments (2022) (2022 Amendments) by deleting the statutory examples relating to the appearance of type and instead indicating in these comments a broader universe of factors that are applicable to both written and electronic presenta- tions. This approach is intended to be both more protective of consumers and more useful to drafters by providing more clarity and flexibility in the meth- ods that may be used to call attention to a term.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>The attributes of a reasonable per- son against which a term is to operate can vary depending upon the nature of the transaction and the market in which the transaction occurs. For example, as- sume that a merchant of goods wishes to enter into a transaction for the sale or lease of goods which does not include an implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for particular purpose. Depend- ing on the particular transaction, the person against which the term exclud- ing implied warranties is to operate may be a large business buyer or lessee, a small business, or a consumer. Simi- larly, the determination of whether a term is conspicuous may, depending on the context, yield a different conclusion when the term is used in a standard form agreement than when terms of the agreement are the subject of negotiation or discussion.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>Terms presented in an online record raise issues that differ in some respects from the issues associated with present- ing the same terms in a writing. For ex- ample, how a term appears depends to some extent on the equipment and set- tings used by the person presented with the term.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>The test of whether a term is con- spicuous remains constant notwith- standing the different contexts refer- enced above. A term is conspicuous if its appearance and presentation are such that it ought to be noticed by a reason- able person against which the term is to operate. If the term is in a standard form intended for use in many agree- ments, the determination of whether the term is conspicuous may be made with reference to typical likely parties to the agreements, taking into account all aspects of the transaction, the range of likely equipment and settings used by such parties, and the education, so- phistication, disabilities, and other at- tributes of such parties. If the term is not in a standard form, the determina- tion of whether it is conspicuous should be made with reference to a reasonable person in the position of the actual per- son against which it is to operate.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>Factors relevant to whether a term is conspicuous include, but are not lim- ited to, the following:</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(i) The use of headings and text that contrast with the surrounding text. For example, a term is likely to be con- spicuous if it is introduced by a heading in uppercase letters equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text. Simi- larly, a term is likely to be conspicuous if set out in language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surround- ing text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language. However, even with those characteristics, for a term to be con- spicuous the overall statutory test must always be met. For example, even if in bold, uppercase letters, a term might not be conspicuous if placed among other terms also in bold, uppercase let- ters so there is no contrast with the sur- rounding text or if the application of other factors causes the term not to be provided such that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(ii) The placement of the term in the record. A term appearing at, or hy- perlinked from, text at the beginning of a record, or near the place where the person against which the term is to op- erate must signify assent, is more likely to be conspicuous than a term in the middle of a lengthy record absent the use of a method reasonably designed to draw the person&#8217;s attention to the term in middle of the record (for example, by providing separate reasonable notice of the term before presenting the record containing the term to the person for as- sent or forcing the person to stop on a screen highlighting the term during the presentation of the record for assent).</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(iii) If terms are available only through the use of a hyperlink, in ad- dition to the placement of the hyperlink as described above, factors to be consid- ered include whether there is language drawing attention to the hyperlink and describing its function, and the size and color of the text used for the hyperlink and any related language.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(iv) The language of the heading, if any. A misleading heading&#8212;such as the heading &#8220;Warranty&#8221; for a para- graph that contains a disclaimer of warranties&#8212;might cause a reasonable person to fail to notice the language that would disclaim warranties, so that the term would not be conspicuous.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(v) The effort needed to access the term. The process and flow of the dis- play and presentation is also relevant. For example, a term accessible only by triggering multiple hyperlinks is less likely to be conspicuous than a term ac- cessible from a single hyperlink.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(vi) Whether the person against which the term is to operate must sep- arately assent to or acknowledge the term. Obtaining separate assent or ac- knowledgment of a term is generally sufficient to make the term conspicuous.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>As noted above, the evolution of tech- nology has led to an evolution in the ways in which terms in an electronic record are displayed or presented. A term displayed or presented in a novel way utilizing emerging technologies is, of course, conspicuous if the effect of the display or presentation is that a reason- able person against which the term is to operate ought to have noticed it.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>This definition deals only with re- quirements that a term be conspicuous (or noted conspicuously) that are stated in particular provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code. Other protective doc- trines designed to assure that assent is meaningful that are found in law out- side the UCC may also apply. See Sec- tion 1&#8211;103(b).</i></p>

An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communi- cating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines.

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Source:</b> Former Sections 1&#8211;102(3)&#8211;(4) and 1&#8211;204(1).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> This section combines the rules from subsections (3) and (4) of for- mer Section 1&#8211;102 and subsection (1) of former Section 1&#8211;204. No substantive changes are made.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (a) states affirma- tively at the outset that freedom of contract is a principle of the Uniform Commercial Code: &#8220;the effect&#8221; of its provisions may be varied by &#8220;agree- ment.&#8221; The meaning of the statute it- self must be found in its text, includ- ing its definitions, and in appropriate extrinsic aids; it cannot be varied by agreement. But the Uniform Commercial <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Code seeks to avoid the type of interference with evolutionary growth found in pre-Code cases such as Man- hattan Co. v. Morgan, 242 N.Y. 38, 150 N.E. 594 (1926). Thus, private parties cannot make an instrument negotiable within the meaning of Article 3 except as provided in Section 3&#8211;104; nor can they change the meaning of such terms as &#8220;bona fide purchaser,&#8221; &#8220;holder in due course,&#8221; or &#8220;due negotiation,&#8221; as used in the Uniform Commercial Code. But an agreement can change the legal conse- quences that would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Uniform Commer- cial Code. &#8220;Agreement&#8221; here includes the effect given to course of dealing, usage of trade and course of perfor- mance by Sections 1&#8211;201 and 1&#8211;303; the effect of an agreement on the rights of third parties is left to specific provi- sions of the Uniform Commercial Code and to supplementary principles appli- cable under Section 1&#8211;103. The rights of third parties under Section 9&#8211;317 when a security interest is unperfect- ed, for example, cannot be destroyed by a clause in the security agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This principle of freedom of contract is subject to specific exceptions found elsewhere in the Uniform Commercial Code and to the general exception stat- ed here. The specific exceptions vary in explicitness: the statute of frauds found in Section 2&#8211;201, for example, does not explicitly preclude oral waiver of the requirement of a writing, but a fair reading denies enforcement to such a waiver as part of the &#8220;contract&#8221; made unenforceable; Section 9&#8211;602, on the other hand, is a quite explicit limitation on freedom of contract. Un- der the exception for &#8220;the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonable- ness and care prescribed by [the Uni- form Commercial Code],&#8221; provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code pre- scribing such obligations are not to be disclaimed. However, the section also recognizes the prevailing practice of having agreements set forth standards by which due diligence is measured and explicitly provides that, in the absence of a showing that the stan- dards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls. In this connection, Section 1&#8211;303 incorporating into the agreement prior course of dealing and usages of trade is of particular impor- tance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b) also recognizes that nothing is stronger evidence of a rea- sonable time than the fixing of such time by a fair agreement between the parties. However, provision is made for disregarding a clause which whether by inadvertence or overreaching fixes a time so unreasonable that it amounts to eliminating all remedy under the contract. The parties are not required to fix the most reasonable time but may fix any time which is not obviously un- fair as judged by the time of contract- ing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. An agreement that varies the effect of provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code may do so by stat- ing the rules that will govern in lieu of the provisions varied. Alternatively, the parties may vary the effect of such provisions by stating that their rela- tionship will be governed by recognized bodies of rules or principles applicable to commercial transactions. Such bod- ies of rules or principles may include, for example, those that are promulgat- ed by intergovernmental authorities such as UNCITRAL or Unidroit (see, e.g., Unidroit Principles of Internation- al Commercial Contracts), or non-legal codes such as trade codes.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (c) is intended to make it clear that, as a matter of draft- ing, phrases such as &#8220;unless otherwise agreed&#8221; have been used to avoid contro- versy as to whether the subject matter of a particular section does or does not fall within the exceptions to subsection (b), but absence of such words contains no negative implication since under subsection (b) the general and residual <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rule is that the effect of all provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code may be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1&#8211;303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A &#8220;course of performance&#8221; is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the perfor- mance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the perfor- mance or acquiesces in it without objection.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A &#8220;course of dealing&#8221; is a sequence of conduct concerning previ- ous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) A &#8220;usage of trade&#8221; is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the mean- ing of the parties&#8217; agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of deal- ing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consis- tent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Subject to Section 2&#8211;209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comments</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Source:</b> Former Sections 1&#8211;205, 2&#8211;208, and Section 2A&#8211;207.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> This sec- tion integrates the &#8220;course of perfor- mance&#8221; concept from Articles 2 and 2A into the principles of former Sec- tion 1&#8211;205, which deals with course of dealing and usage of trade. In so doing, the section slightly modifies the ar- ticulation of the course of performance rules to fit more comfortably with the approach and structure of former Sec- tion 1&#8211;205. There are also slight modi- fications to be more consistent with the definition of &#8220;agreement&#8221; in former Sec- tion 1&#8211;201(3). It should be noted that a course of performance that might otherwise establish a defense to the obligation of a party to a negotiable in- strument is not available as a defense against a holder in due course who took the instrument without notice of that course of performance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The Uniform Commercial Code rejects both the &#8220;lay-dictionary&#8221; and the &#8220;conveyancer&#8217;s&#8221; reading of a commercial agreement. Instead the meaning of the agreement of the par- ties is to be determined by the language used by them and by their action, read and interpreted in the light of commer- cial practices and other surrounding circumstances. The measure and back- ground for interpretation are set by the commercial context, which may explain and supplement even the language of a formal or final writing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. &#8220;Course of dealing,&#8221; as defined in subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a &#8220;course of performance.&#8221; &#8220;Course of dealing&#8221; may enter the agreement either by explicit provisions of the agreement or by tacit recognition.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The Uniform Commercial Code deals with &#8220;usage of trade&#8221; as a factor in reaching the commercial meaning of the agreement that the par- ties have made. The language used is to be interpreted as meaning what it may fairly be expected to mean to parties involved in the particular commercial transaction in a given locality or in a given vocation or trade. By adopting in this context the term &#8220;usage of trade,&#8221; the Uniform Commercial Code express- es its intent to reject those cases which see evidence of &#8220;custom&#8221; as represent- ing an effort to displace or negate &#8220;es- tablished rules of law.&#8221; A distinction is to be drawn between mandatory rules of law such as the Statute of Frauds provisions of Article 2 on Sales whose very office is to control and restrict the actions of the parties, and which can- not be abrogated by agreement, or by a usage of trade, and those rules of law (such as those in Part 3 of Article 2 on Sales) which fill in points which the parties have not considered and in fact agreed upon. The latter rules hold &#8220;unless otherwise agreed&#8221; but yield to the contrary agreement of the parties. Part of the agreement of the parties to which such rules yield is to be sought for in the usages of trade which furnish the background and give particular meaning to the language used, and are the framework of common understand- ing controlling any general rules of law which hold only when there is no such understanding.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A usage of trade under sub- section (c) must have the &#8220;regularity of observance&#8221; specified. The ancient English tests for &#8220;custom&#8221; are aban- doned in this connection. Therefore, it is not required that a usage of trade be &#8220;ancient or immemorial,&#8221; &#8220;universal,&#8221; <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>or the like. Under the requirement of subsection (c) full recognition is thus available for new usages and for us- ages currently observed by the great majority of decent dealers, even though dissidents ready to cut corners do not agree. There is room also for proper recognition of usage agreed upon by merchants in trade codes.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The policies of the Uniform Commercial Code controlling explicit unconscionable contracts and clauses (Sections 1&#8211;304, 2&#8211;302) apply to im- plicit clauses that rest on usage of trade and carry forward the policy underlying the ancient requirement that a custom or usage must be &#8220;rea- sonable.&#8221; However, the emphasis is shifted. The very fact of commercial acceptance makes out a prima facie case that the usage is reasonable, and the burden is no longer on the usage to establish itself as being reasonable. But the anciently established policing of usage by the courts is continued to the extent necessary to cope with the situation arising if an unconscionable or dishonest practice should become standard.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Subsection (d), giving the pre- scribed effect to usages of which the parties &#8220;are or should be aware,&#8221; re- inforces the provision of subsection (c) requiring not universality but only the described &#8220;regularity of observance&#8221; of the practice or method. This subsection also reinforces the point of subsection (c) that such usages may be either gen- eral to trade or particular to a special branch of trade.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Although the definition of &#8220;agreement&#8221; in Section 1&#8211;201 includes the elements of course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade, the fact that express reference is made in some sections to those elements is not to be construed as carrying a con- trary intent or implication elsewhere. Compare Section 1&#8211;302(c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. In cases of a well established line of usage varying from the general rules of the Uniform Commercial Code where the precise amount of the varia- tion has not been worked out into a sin- gle standard, the party relying on the usage is entitled, in any event, to the minimum variation demonstrated. The whole is not to be disregarded because no particular line of detail has been es- tablished. In case a dominant pattern has been fairly evidenced, the party relying on the usage is entitled under this section to go to the trier of fact on the question of whether such dominant pattern has been incorporated into the agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Subsection (g) is intended to insure that this Act&#8217;s liberal recogni- tion of the needs of commerce in regard to usage of trade shall not be made into an instrument of abuse.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1&#8211;304. Obligation of Good Faith</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Every contract or duty within [the Uniform Commercial Code] imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comments</b></p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> Except for changing the form of reference to the Uniform Commercial Code, this section is identical to former Section 1&#8211;203.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section sets forth a basic principle running throughout the Uni- form Commercial Code. The principle is that in commercial transactions good faith is required in the performance and enforcement of all agreements or duties. While this duty is explicitly stated in some provisions of the Uni- form Commercial Code, the applicability <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the duty is broader than merely these situations and applies generally, as stated in this section, to the perfor- mance or enforcement of every contract or duty within this Act. It is further im- plemented by Section 1&#8211;303 on course of dealing, course of performance, and usage of trade. This section does not support an independent cause of action for failure to perform or enforce in good faith. Rather, this section means that a failure to perform or enforce, in good faith, a specific duty or obligation un- der the contract, constitutes a breach of that contract or makes unavailable, under the particular circumstances, a remedial right or power. This distinc- tion makes it clear that the doctrine of good faith merely directs a court towards interpreting contracts within the commercial context in which they are created, performed, and enforced, and does not create a separate duty of fairness and reasonableness which can be independently breached.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. &#8220;Performance and enforce- ment&#8221; of contracts and duties within the Uniform Commercial Code include the exercise of rights created by the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<p class="indent">(b) Any right or obligation declared by [the Uniform Commercial Code] is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> Other than changes in the form of reference to the Uniform Commercial Code, this section is identical to former Section 1&#8211;106.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (a) is intended to effect three propositions. The first is to negate the possibility of unduly narrow or technical interpretation of remedial provisions by providing that the rem- edies in the Uniform Commercial Code are to be liberally administered to the end stated in this section. The second is to make it clear that compensatory damages are limited to compensation. They do not include consequential or special damages, or penal damages; and the Uniform Commercial Code elsewhere makes it clear that damages must be minimized. Cf. Sections 1&#8211;304, 2&#8211;706(1), and 2&#8211;712(2). The third pur- pose of subsection (a) is to reject any doctrine that damages must be calcula- ble with mathematical accuracy. Com- pensatory damages are often at best approximate: they have to be proved with whatever definiteness and accu- racy the facts permit, but no more. Cf. Section 2&#8211;204(3).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Under subsection (b), any right or obligation described in the Uniform Commercial Code is enforce- able by action, even though no remedy may be expressly provided, unless a particular provision specifies a differ- ent and limited effect. Whether specific performance or other equitable relief is available is determined not by this sec- tion but by specific provisions and by supplementary principles. Cf. Sections 1&#8211;103, 2&#8211;716.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>3. &#8220;Consequential&#8221; or &#8220;special&#8221; damages and &#8220;penal&#8221; damages are not defined in the Uniform Commercial Code; rather, these terms are used in the sense in which they are used out- side the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1&#8211;306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach</b></p>

Such words as &#8220;without prejudice,&#8221; &#8220;under protest,&#8221; or the like are suf- ficient.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comments</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Source:</b> Former Section 1&#8211;207.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> This section is identical to former Section 1&#8211;207.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section provides machin- ery for the continuation of performance along the lines contemplated by the contract despite a pending dispute, by adopting the mercantile device of go- ing ahead with delivery, acceptance, or payment &#8220;without prejudice,&#8221; &#8220;under protest,&#8221; &#8220;under reserve,&#8221; &#8220;with reser- vation of all our rights,&#8221; and the like. All of these phrases completely reserve all rights within the meaning of this section. The section therefore contem- plates that limited as well as general reservations and acceptance by a party may be made &#8220;subject to satisfaction of our purchaser,&#8221; &#8220;subject to acceptance by our customers,&#8221; or the like.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. This section does not add any new requirement of language of res- ervation where not already required by law, but merely provides a specific measure on which a party can rely as that party makes or concurs in any in- terim adjustment in the course of per- formance. It does not affect or impair the provisions of this Act such as those under which the buyer&#8217;s remedies for defect survive acceptance without be- ing expressly claimed if notice of the defects is given within a reasonable time. Nor does it disturb the policy of those cases which restrict the effect of a waiver of a defect to reasonable limits under the circumstances, even though no such reservation is expressed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The section is not addressed to the creation or loss of remedies in the ordi- nary course of performance but rather to a method of procedure where one party is claiming as of right something which the other believes to be unwar- ranted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (b) states that this section does not apply to an accord and satisfaction. Section 3&#8211;311 governs if an accord and satisfaction is attempted by tender of a negotiable instrument as stated in that section. If Section 3&#8211;311 <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>does not apply, the issue of whether an accord and satisfaction has been effect- ed is determined by the law of contract. Whether or not Section 3&#8211;311 applies, this section has no application to an ac- cord and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">A term providing that one party or that party&#8217;s successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral &#8220;at will&#8221; or when the party &#8220;deems itself insecure,&#8221; or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comments</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Source:</b> Former Section 1&#8211;208.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes from former law:</b> Except for minor stylistic changes, this section is identical to former Section 1&#8211;208.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The common use of accel- eration clauses in many transactions governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, including sales of good on credit notes payable at a definite time, and secured transactions, raises an issue as to the effect to be given to a clause that seemingly grants the power to accelerate at the whim and caprice of one party. This section is intended to make clear that despite language that might be so construed and which fur- ther might be held to make the agree- ment void as against public policy or to make the contract illusory or too indefi- nite for enforcement, the option is to be exercised only in the good faith belief that the prospect of payment or perfor- mance is impaired.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Obviously this section has no ap- plication to demand instruments or obligations whose very nature permits call at any time with or without reason. This section applies only to an obliga- tion of payment or performance which in the first instance is due at a future date.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b><i>Purposes:</i></b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. Subsection (3) makes it clear that this Article does not govern aspects of a transaction that, although in the form of a sale or contract to sell, create a security interest. See Sections 1&#8211;201(b) (35); 9&#8211;109(a)(1). Of course, this Article does apply to any sales aspects of such a transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Many ordinary transactions involve both a sale of goods and the pro- vision of services, a lease of other goods, or a sale, lease, or license of property other than goods. In its original formu- lation, Article 2 provided no guidance on whether or to what extent the Article applied to such a hybrid transaction, although by defining a &#8220;sale&#8221; as &#8220;the passing of title [to goods] from the seller to the buyer for a price,&#8221; Section 1&#8211;206 arguably regarded such transactions as sales. This section was substantially revised to address hybrid transactions pursuant to the Uniform Commer- cial Code Amendments (2022) (2022 Amendments). See Section 2&#8211;106(5) (defining &#8220;hybrid transaction&#8221;).</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>In dealing with the issue of whether and to what extent, under the pre-2022 version of this section, Article 2 applied to hybrid transactions, most courts used some version of a &#8220;predominant purpose&#8221; test. Under those tests, Article 2 applied either in full or not at all, de- pending on whether the hybrid transac- tion, at its inception, was predominantly about the goods. In some cases, courts looked instead to the &#8220;gravamen of the claim,&#8221; applying Article 2 to issues relating to the goods and applying other law to issues relating to other aspects of the transaction. Still other courts used what was sometimes referred to as the &#8220;bifurcation approach,&#8221; under which Article 2 applied to the sale-of- goods aspect of a hybrid transaction and other law applies to the other as- pects of the transaction. The bifurcation approach was similar to the gravamen of the claim, but instead of applying all of Article 2 to some, but not all, types of claims relating to a hybrid transac- tion, it distinguished the provisions in Article 2 that deal with the goods from those that deal with the transaction as a whole, and applied only the former in a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>Subsection (2) codifies aspects of the predominant purpose test and the bi- furcation approach, establishing a two- tiered test. If the sale-of-goods aspects of a hybrid transaction predominate, then Article 2 applies. If the other aspects of the hybrid transaction predominate, then the provisions of Article 2 which relate primarily to the sale of goods, as opposed to those that relate to the trans- action as a whole, apply. This approach has the benefit, for example, of ensur- ing that a person acquiring ownership of goods in a transaction in which the sale-of-goods aspects do not predomi- nate is a buyer that benefits from the warranty provisions of this Article and may have a right to recover the goods from the seller and thereby may qualify <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>as a buyer in ordinary course of busi- ness under Section 1&#8211;201(b)(9).</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. It is important to note that, in contrast to the frequent reference (un- der prior case law in many states) to the predominant purpose of a hybrid trans- action, subsection (2) focuses on which aspect of the transaction predominates without requiring a finding of the &#8220;pur- pose&#8221; of either or both parties (although that purpose, when evident, may be a relevant factor in deciding which as- pect predominates). The determination of which aspect of a hybrid transaction predominates is left to the court, which should evaluate each transaction on a case-by-case basis without the necessity of applying any particular formula. Factors that may be relevant to that de- termination include, but are not limited to, the language of the agreement, the portion of the total price that is attrib- utable to the sale of goods (as to which an agreed-upon allocation will ordi- narily be binding on the parties), the purposes of the parties in entering into the transaction (when that is ascertain- able), and the nature of the businesses of the parties (such as whether the seller is in the business of selling goods of that kind). Because the definition of &#8220;goods&#8221; expressly includes &#8220;specially manufac- tured goods,&#8221; services involved in man- ufacturing goods are normally attribut- able to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction. Services in designing spe- cially manufactured goods, however, would not normally be attributable to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transac- tion.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. If the sale-of-goods aspects of a hybrid transaction predominate, then this Article applies to the transaction. However, the application of this Ar- ticle to a hybrid transaction does not preclude the application of principles of law and equity to supplement the provisions of this Article, see Section 1&#8211;103(b), nor does it preclude, in appro- priate circumstances, the application of other law to the non-sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction. Whether it is appropriate to apply such other law will depend in part on what purposes the other law is designed to achieve and whether application of the other law would be likely to interfere with the ap- plication of this Article.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 1.</i></b> <i>Owner hires Contrac- tor to replace the roof on a structure. As part of the transaction, Contractor promises to remove the existing shin- gles and install new shingles, which Contractor is providing. The transac- tion is a hybrid transaction because it involves the passing of title to the new shingles and the provision of services. If the sale-of-goods aspects of the transac- tion predominate, this Article applies to the transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 2.</i></b> <i>Same facts as in Exam- ple 1. Even if the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction predominate, other law might apply to the services aspects of the transaction. For example, if ap- plicable law regulates the provision of roofing services, such as by requiring the roofer to be licensed, requiring spec- ified disclosures, requiring or implying a warranty with respect to the quality of services, or giving the property owner a brief period of time to cancel the con- tract, such other law might apply.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 3.</i></b> <i>In a single transaction, Seller agrees to sell a warehouse full of goods to Buyer. The transaction in- cludes the goods contained in the ware- house, the warehouse itself, and the real property on which the warehouse is situated. Assume the goods aspects of the transaction predominate. The ap- plication of this Article to the transac- tion does not preclude the application of real property law to the real-property aspects of the transaction. Accordingly, whether the sale of the real property complies with the applicable require- ments of real property law is deter- mined by law other than this Article. Other law will also determine whether consummation of the sale of the real <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>property is a condition to the parties&#8217; obligations to buy and sell the goods.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. If the sale-of-goods aspects of a hybrid transaction do not predominate, under subsection (3), the provisions of this Article relating primarily to the sale of goods, as opposed to the trans- action as a whole, apply. These provi- sions include those relating to war- ranties under Sections 2&#8211;212, 2&#8211;313, 2&#8211;314, 2&#8211;315, 2&#8211;316, 2&#8211;317, 2&#8211;318; tender of delivery and risk of loss under Sections 2&#8211;503, 2&#8211;504, 2&#8211;509, 2&#8211;510; acceptance, rejection, and cure under Sections 2&#8211;508, 2&#8211;601, 2&#8211;602, 2&#8211;603, 2&#8211;604, 2&#8211;605, 2&#8211;606; and remedies for non-delivery of the goods or for tender of nonconforming goods under Sections 2&#8211;711, 7&#8211;712, 7&#8211;713, 2&#8211;714, 2&#8211;715, 2&#8211;716. In contrast, the provisions of this Article dealing with the transac- tion as a whole do not apply. These provisions include those relating to: the requirement of a signed record, Section 2&#8211;201; contract formation, Sections 2&#8211;204 through 2&#8211;207; and whether consideration is needed to modify the agreement, Section 2&#8211;209.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 4.</i></b> <i>Owner sends a pur- chase order to Contractor offering to enter into a contract with Contractor to replace the roof on a structure. The proposed transaction involves Con- tractor removing the existing shingles and installing new shingles, which Contractor is to provide. Contractor re- sponds with a confirmation purporting to accept but containing additional and different terms. The transaction is a hy- brid transaction because it involves the passing of title to the new shingles and the provision of services. If the sale-of- goods aspects of the transaction do not predominate, this Article does not ap- ply to determine whether a contract was formed. That issue is governed by other law.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 5.</i></b> <i>Under the facts of Ex- ample 1, assume that the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction do not pre- dominate. The agreement provides that the job will be completed by December 31. Due to unforeseen circumstances af- fecting the availability of supplies and labor, the job is not completed by the agreed-upon deadline. Whether Con- tractor&#8217;s failure to perform on time is excused is determined by general con- tract law, rather than by this Article (Section 2&#8211;615).</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 6.</i></b> <i>Under the facts of Ex- ample 1, assume that the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction do not pre- dominate. A dispute between the parties arises and during litigation one party seeks to admit evidence of usage of trade to supplement or explain the par- ties&#8217; written agreement. If the proffered evidence relates to the sale-of-goods as- pects of the transaction, the parol evi- dence rule in this Article, Section 2&#8211;202 applies. If the proffered evidence relates to the other aspects of the transaction or to the transaction as a whole, other law will govern the admissibility of the evidence.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 7.</i></b> <i>Restaurateur hires Remodeler to remodel Restaurateur&#8217;s kitchen. The transaction requires Re- modeler to supply a new oven meeting detailed specifications, but the services aspects of the transaction predominate. The oven supplied does not meet a mi- nor aspect of those specifications (but does substantially satisfy the specifica- tions as a whole). Whether Restaura- teur may reject the oven (or must retain it subject to price adjustment), whether Restaurateur has a right to cover by purchasing a substitute oven, and the measure of Restaurateur&#8217;s damages for the oven&#8217;s nonconformity to the specifi- cations are determined by this Article.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 8.</i></b> <i>Restaurateur hires Remodeler to remodel Restaurateur&#8217;s kitchen by a specified completion date. The transaction requires Remodeler to supply a new oven, but the services as- pects of the transaction predominate. Remodeler breaches by failing to complete <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the project by the specified date. The measure of Restaurateur&#8217;s dam- ages for Remodeler&#8217;s failure to timely complete the project is not determined by this Article.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. The rules of subsections (1) and (2) are essentially gap fillers that apply when the parties&#8217; agreement is silent on what legal rules govern the different aspects of their transaction. In general, parties are free to preclude the application of this Article to the aspects of their transaction that are not about the sale of goods.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 9.</i></b> <i>Robotics Manufactur- er contracts to design, build, and sell customized robotics to Car Maker. The transaction includes a sale of goods and the provision of services and is therefore a hybrid transaction. Assume that the sale-of-goods aspects predominate. The parties may, in their agreement, pro- vide that Article 2 does not govern the services aspects of the transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>As Example 9 illustrates, parties may agree that Article 2 will not govern non-goods aspects of a hybrid transac- tion, even though the sale-of-goods as- pects predominate. But, when sale-of- goods aspects predominate, the parties cannot agree that Article 2 does not gov- ern matters that relate to the transac- tion as a whole, such as contract forma- tion and enforceability. For example, in a situation such as Example 9, if the requirements of the Section 2&#8211;201 stat- ute of frauds are not satisfied, it would make little sense to hold that the ser- vices aspects of the transaction are en- forceable when the provision of services is clearly dependent on the existence of the sale-of-goods aspects. Of course, even when this article applies, its provi- sions may be varied by agreement to the extent provided in section 1&#8211;302.</i></p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None. But see Sections 15(2), (5), 16(c), 45(2) and 71, Uniform Sales Act, and Sections 35 and 37, Uniform Bills of Lading Act for examples of the policy expressly provided for in this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This Article assumes that transactions between professionals in a given field require special and clear rules which may not apply to a casu- al or inexperienced seller or buyer. It thus adopts a policy of expressly stat- ing rules applicable &#8220;between mer- chants&#8221; and &#8220;as against a merchant&#8221;, wherever they are needed instead of making them depend upon the circum- stances of each case as in the statutes cited above. This section lays the foun- dation of this policy by defining those who are to be regarded as professionals or &#8220;merchants&#8221; and by stating when a transaction is deemed to be &#8220;between merchants&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The term &#8220;merchant&#8221; as de- fined here roots in the &#8220;law merchant&#8221; concept of a professional in business. The professional status under the defi- nition may be based upon specialized knowledge as to the goods, specialized knowledge as to business practices, or specialized knowledge as to both and which kind of specialized knowledge may be sufficient to establish the mer- chant status is indicated by the nature of the provisions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The special provisions as to mer- chants appear only in this Article and they are of three kinds. Sections 2&#8211;201(2), 2&#8211;205, 2&#8211;207 and 2&#8211;209 dealing with the statute of frauds, firm offers, confirmatory memoranda and modification rest on normal busi- ness practices which are or ought to be typical of and familiar to any person in business. For purposes of these sec- tions almost every person in business would, therefore, be deemed to be a &#8220;merchant&#8221; under the language &#8220;who &#8230; by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices &#8230; involved in the trans- action &#8230;&#8221; since the practices involved in the transaction are non-specialized business practices such as answering mail. In this type of provision, banks or even universities, for example, well may be &#8220;merchants.&#8221; But even these sections only apply to a merchant in his mercantile capacity; a lawyer or bank <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>president buying fishing tackle for his own use is not a merchant.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">On the other hand, in Section 2&#8211;314 on the warranty of merchantability, such warranty is implied only &#8220;if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.&#8221; Obviously this qualification restricts the implied war- ranty to a much smaller group than everyone who is engaged in business and requires a professional status as to particular kinds of goods. The ex- ception in Section 2&#8211;402(2) for reten- tion of possession by a merchant-seller falls in the same class; as does Section 2&#8211;403(2) on entrusting of possession to a merchant &#8220;who deals in goods of that kind&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A third group of sections includes 2&#8211;103(1)(b), which provides that in the case of a merchant &#8220;good faith&#8221; includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade; 2&#8211;327(1)(c), 2&#8211;603 and 2&#8211;605, dealing with responsibilities of merchant buy- ers to follow seller&#8217;s instructions, etc.; 2&#8211;509 on risk of loss, and 2&#8211;609 on ad- equate assurance of performance. This group of sections applies to persons who are merchants under either the &#8220;practices&#8221; or the &#8220;goods&#8221; aspect of the definition of merchant.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The &#8220;or to whom such knowl- edge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker &#8230;&#8221; clause of the definition of merchant means that even persons such as uni- versities, for example, can come within the definition of merchant if they have regular purchasing departments or business personnel who are familiar with business practices and who are equipped to take any action required.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. In some transactions, the pass- ing of title to goods from the seller to the buyer in return for a price is part of a larger transaction. The other as- pects of the transaction might involve the seller providing services to the buyer, the seller leasing other goods to the buyer, or the seller transferring to the buyer rights to property other than goods. Such a transaction is a &#8220;hybrid transaction,&#8221; as defined in subsection (5). Section 2&#8211;102 indicates the extent to which this Article applies to a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. A hybrid transaction is a sin- gle transaction. If contracting parties enter into separate agreements at the same time, each agreement creating a separate transaction, each transaction must be evaluated separately to deter- mine if it is a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 1.</i></b> <i>To sell an ongoing business, Seller and Buyer enter into three separate written agreements: (i) a sale of goods used in the business; (ii) an agreement for Seller to provide con- sulting services to Buyer for a period of six months; and (iii) a sale of intangible assets associated with the business. Each agreement creates a separate transaction. None of those transactions involves both a sale of goods and the provision of services, the lease of other goods, or the sale, lease, or license of property other than goods. Thus, none of the separate transactions constitutes a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 2.</i></b> <i>To sell an ongoing business, Seller and Buyer enter into two separate written agreements: (i) a sale of goods and intangible assets used in the business; and (ii) an agreement for Seller to provide consulting services to Buyer for a period of six months, and not to compete with Buyer for a period of one year. The agreement to sell goods and intangible assets creates a hybrid transaction. The agreement for consult- ing services, a separate transaction, is not a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><i>Even when contracting parties enter into a single agreement involving both a sale of goods and a sale, lease, or li- cense of other property or the provision of services, the elements of the single agreement may be so independent that they create separate transactions. In that case, no hybrid transaction would exist merely because the separate trans- actions arose out of the same agreement.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b><i>Example 3.</i></b> <i>Farmer A and Farmer B sign a written agreement pursuant to which Farmer A will sell a tractor to Farmer B and Farmer A will board and feed Farmer B&#8217;s cattle until the cat- tle are sold. The agreement specifies a price for the tractor, which is due upon delivery, and specifies a mechanism for determining the price for Farmer A&#8217;s services, which is to be paid when the cattle are sold. The parties would have entered into an agreement to buy and sell the tractor even if they had not en- tered into an agreement to board and feed the cattle, and vice-versa. Two sep- arate transactions arise from the single agreement, neither of which is a hybrid transaction. Article 2 applies to the sale of the tractor. Other law applies to the agreement to board and feed the cattle.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b><i>Example 4.</i></b> <i>In a single record, Landscaper agrees to sell plants to Homeowner and to install the plants on Homeowner&#8217;s property. The agreement specifies a total price but provides no mechanism for determining what por- tion of the price is allocable to the sale of plants and what portion is allocable to the installation services. Because the terms of the agreement relating to the sale of goods and those relating to ser- vices are not severable, the transaction is a hybrid transaction.</i></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2&#8211;107. Goods to Be Severed From Realty: Recording</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this Article if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this Article whether the subject mat- ter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identifica- tion effect a present sale before severance.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Section 4, Uniform Sales Act (which was based on Section 17 of the Statute of 29 Charles II).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Completely rephrased; re- stricted to sale of goods. See also Sec- tions 1&#8211;206, 8&#8211;319 and 9&#8211;203.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b> The changed phraseology of this section is intended to make it clear that:</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The required writing need not contain all the material terms of the contract and such material terms as are stated need not be precisely stated. All that is required is that the writing afford a basis for believing that the of- fered oral evidence rests on a real trans- action. It may be written in lead pencil on a scratch pad. It need not indicate which party is the buyer and which the seller. The only term which must ap- pear is the quantity term which need not be accurately stated but recovery is limited to the amount stated. The price, time and place of payment or de- livery, the general quality of the goods, or any particular warranties may all be omitted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Special emphasis must be placed on the permissibility of omitting the price term in view of the insistence of some courts on the express inclusion of this term even where the parties have contracted on the basis of a published price list. In many valid contracts for sale the parties do not mention the price in express terms, the buyer be- ing bound to pay and the seller to ac- cept a reasonable price which the trier of the fact may well be trusted to de- termine. Again, frequently the price is not mentioned since the parties have based their agreement on a price list or catalogue known to both of them and this list serves as an efficient safe- guard against perjury. Finally, &#8220;mar- ket&#8221; prices and valuations that are cur- rent in the vicinity constitute a similar check. Thus if the price is not stated in the memorandum it can normally be supplied without danger of fraud. Of course if the &#8220;price&#8221; consists of goods rather than money the quantity of goods must be stated.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Only three definite and invariable requirements as to the memorandum are made by this subsection. First, it must evidence a contract for the sale of goods; second, it must be &#8220;signed&#8221;, a word which includes any authenti- cation which identifies the party to be charged; and third, it must specify a quantity.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. &#8220;Partial performance&#8221; as a substitute for the required memoran- dum can validate the contract only for the goods which have been accepted or for which payment has been made and accepted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Receipt and acceptance either of goods or of the price constitutes an unambiguous overt admission by both parties that a contract actually exists. If the court can make a just apportion- ment, therefore, the agreed price of any goods actually delivered can be recov- ered without a writing or, if the price has been paid, the seller can be forced to deliver an apportionable part of the goods. The overt actions of the parties make admissible evidence of the other terms of the contract necessary to a just apportionment. This is true even though the actions of the parties are not in themselves inconsistent with a different transaction such as a consignment <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>for resale or a mere loan of money.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Part performance by the buyer re- quires the delivery of something by him that is accepted by the seller as such performance. Thus, part payment may be made by money or check, ac- cepted by the seller. If the agreed price consists of goods or services, then they must also have been delivered and ac- cepted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Between merchants, failure to answer a written confirmation of a con- tract within ten days of receipt is tan- tamount to a writing under subsection (2) and is sufficient against both par- ties under subsection (1). The only ef- fect, however, is to take away from the party who fails to answer the defense of the Statute of Frauds; the burden of persuading the trier of fact that a con- tract was in fact made orally prior to the written confirmation is unaffected. Compare the effect of a failure to reply under Section 2&#8211;207.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Failure to satisfy the require- ments of this section does not render the contract void for all purposes, but merely prevents it from being judi- cially enforced in favor of a party to the contract. For example, a buyer who takes possession of goods as provided in an oral contract which the seller has not meanwhile repudiated, is not a trespasser. Nor would the Statute of Frauds provisions of this section be a defense to a third person who wrong- fully induces a party to refuse to per- form an oral contract, even though the injured party cannot maintain an ac- tion for damages against the party so refusing to perform.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The requirement of &#8220;signing&#8221; is discussed in the comment to Section 1&#8211;201.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. It is not necessary that the writing be delivered to anybody. It need not be signed or authenticated by both parties but it is, of course, not sufficient against one who has not signed it. Prior to a dispute no one can determine which party&#8217;s signing of the memorandum may be necessary but from the time of contracting each party should be aware that to him it is sign- ing by the other which is important.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. If the making of a contract is admitted in court, either in a writ- ten pleading, by stipulation or by oral statement before the court, no addi- tional writing is necessary for protec- tion against fraud. Under this section it is no longer possible to admit the con- tract in court and still treat the Statute as a defense. However, the contract is not thus conclusively established. The admission so made by a party is itself evidential against him of the truth of the facts so admitted and of nothing more; as against the other party, it is not evidential at all.</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing<b><sup>*</sup></b> to have been intended also as a complete and exclu- sive statement of the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sions:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section definitely rejects:</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(a) Any assumption that be- cause a writing has been worked out which is final on some matters, it is to be taken as including all the matters agreed upon;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(b) The premise that the lan- guage used has the meaning attrib- utable to such language by rules of construction existing in the law rather than the meaning which arises out of the commercial context in which it was used; and</p>
<p class="comment_indent">(c) The requirement that a condition precedent to the admissi- bility of the type of evidence speci- fied in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the court that the language used is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Paragraph (a) makes admis- sible evidence of course of dealing, us- age of trade and course of performance to explain or supplement the terms of any writing stating the agreement of the parties in order that the true un- derstanding of the parties as to the agreement may be reached. Such writ- ings are to be read on the assumption that the course of prior dealings be- tween the parties and the usages of trade were taken for granted when the document was phrased. Unless care- fully negated they have become an ele- ment of the meaning of the words used. Similarly, the course of actual perfor- mance by the parties is considered the best indication of what they intended the writing to mean.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Under paragraph (b) consis- tent additional terms, not reduced to writing, may be proved unless the court finds that the writing was intend- ed by both parties as a complete and exclusive statement of all the terms. If the additional terms are such that, if agreed upon, they would certainly have been included in the document in the view of the court, then evidence of their alleged making must be kept from the trier of fact.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent">Subsection (1) continues without change the basic policy of recognizing any manner of expression of agree- ment, oral, written or otherwise. The legal effect of such an agreement is, of course, qualified by other provisions of this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent">Under subsection (1) appropriate con- duct by the parties may be sufficient to establish an agreement. Subsection (2) is directed primarily to the situ- ation where the interchanged corre- spondence does not disclose the exact point at which the deal was closed, but the actions of the parties indicate that a binding obligation has been under- taken.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent">Subsection (3) states the principle as to &#8220;open terms&#8221; underlying later sections of the Article. If the parties intend to enter into a binding agreement, this subsection recognizes that agreement as valid in law, despite missing terms, if there is any reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy. The test is not certainty as to what the parties were to do nor as to the exact amount of dam- ages due the plaintiff. Nor is the fact that one or more terms are left to be agreed upon enough of itself to defeat an otherwise adequate agreement. Rather, commercial standards on the point of &#8220;indefiniteness&#8221; are intended <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to be applied, this Act making provision elsewhere for missing terms needed for performance, open price, remedies and the like.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent">The more terms the parties leave open, the less likely it is that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement, but their actions may be frequently conclusive on the matter de- spite the omissions.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section is intended to modify the former rule which required that &#8220;firm offers&#8221; be sustained by con- sideration in order to bind, and to re- quire instead that they must merely be characterized as such and expressed in signed writings.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The primary purpose of this section is to give effect to the deliber- ate intention of a merchant to make a current firm offer binding. The delib- eration is shown in the case of an indi- vidualized document by the merchant&#8217;s signature to the offer, and in the case of an offer included on a form supplied by the other party to the transaction by the separate signing of the partic- ular clause which contains the offer. &#8220;Signed&#8221; here also includes authenti- cation but the reasonableness of the authentication herein allowed must be determined in the light of the purpose of the section. The circumstances sur- rounding the signing may justify some- thing less than a formal signature or initialing but typically the kind of au- thentication involved here would con- sist of a minimum of initialing of the clause involved. A handwritten memo- randum on the writer&#8217;s letterhead pur- porting in its terms to &#8220;confirm&#8221; a firm offer already made would be enough to satisfy this section, although not sub- scribed, since under the circumstances it could not be considered a memoran- dum of mere negotiation and it would adequately show its own authenticity. Similarly, an authorized telegram will suffice, and this is true even though the original draft contained only a type- written signature. However, despite settled courses of dealing or usages of the trade whereby firm offers are made by oral communication and relied upon without more evidence, such offers re- main revocable under this Article since authentication by a writing is the es- sence of this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>3. This section is intended to ap- ply to current &#8220;firm&#8221; offers and not to long term options, and an outside time limit of three months during which such offers remain irrevocable has been set. The three month period during which firm offers remain irrevocable under this section need not be stated by days or by date. If the offer states that it is &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; or &#8220;firm&#8221; until the happening of a contingency which will occur within the three month peri- od, it will remain irrevocable until that event. A promise made for a longer pe- riod will operate under this section to bind the offeror only for the first three months of the period but may of course be renewed. If supported by consider- ation it may continue for as long as the parties specify. This section deals only with the offer which is not supported by consideration.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Protection is afforded against the inadvertent signing of a firm offer when contained in a form prepared by the offeree by requiring that such a clause be separately authenticated. If the offer clause is called to the offeror&#8217;s attention and he separately authenti- cates it, he will be bound; Section 2&#8211;302 may operate, however, to prevent an unconscionable result which otherwise would flow from other terms appearing in the form.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Safeguards are provided to offer relief in the case of material mis- take by virtue of the requirement of good faith and the general law of mis- take.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting ac- ceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circum- stances;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current ship- ment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Completely rewritten in this and other sections of this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes: To make it clear that:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Any reasonable manner of acceptance is intended to be regarded as available unless the offeror has made quite clear that it will not be acceptable. Former technical rules as to acceptance, such as requiring that telegraphic offers be accepted by tele- graphed acceptance, etc., are rejected and a criterion that the acceptance be &#8220;in any manner and by any medium reasonable under the circumstances,&#8221; is substituted. This section is intended to remain flexible and its applicability to be enlarged as new media of commu- nication develop or as the more time- saving present day media come into general use.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Either shipment or a prompt promise to ship is made a proper means of acceptance of an offer looking to cur- rent shipment. In accordance with or- dinary commercial understanding the section interprets an order looking to current shipment as allowing accep- tance either by actual shipment or by a prompt promise to ship and rejects the artificial theory that only a single mode of acceptance is normally envisaged by an offer. This is true even though the language of the offer happens to be &#8220;ship at once&#8221; or the like. &#8220;Shipment&#8221; is here used in the same sense as in Sec- tion 2&#8211;504; it does not include the be- ginning of delivery by the seller&#8217;s own truck or by messenger. But loading on the seller&#8217;s own truck might be a begin- ning of performance under subsection (2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The beginning of performance by an offeree can be effective as accep- tance so as to bind the offeror only if followed within a reasonable time by notice to the offeror. Such a beginning of performance must unambiguously express the offeree&#8217;s intention to en- gage himself. For the protection of both parties it is essential that notice follow in due course to constitute acceptance. Nothing in this section however bars the possibility that under the common law performance begun may have an intermediate effect of temporarily bar- ring revocation of the offer, or at the of- feror&#8217;s option, final effect in constitut- ing acceptance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Subsection (1)(b) deals with the situation where a shipment made following an order is shown by a noti- fication of shipment to be referable to that order but has a defect. Such a non- conforming shipment is normally to be understood as intended to close the bargain, even though it proves to have been at the same time a breach. How- ever, the seller by stating that the ship- ment is non-conforming and is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer keeps the shipment or notification from operating as an acceptance.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an ac- ceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addi- tion to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) they materially alter it; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a con- tract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Completely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section is intended to deal with two typical situations. The one is the written confirmation, where an agreement has been reached either orally or by informal correspondence between the parties and is followed by one or both of the parties sending for- mal memoranda embodying the terms so far as agreed upon and adding terms not discussed. The other situation is offer and acceptance, in which a wire or letter expressed and intended as an acceptance or the closing of an agree- ment adds further minor suggestions or proposals such as &#8220;ship by Tuesday,&#8221; &#8220;rush,&#8221; &#8220;ship draft against bill of lading inspection allowed,&#8221; or the like. A fre- quent example of the second situation is the exchange of printed purchase or- der and acceptance (sometimes called &#8220;acknowledgment&#8221;) forms. Because the forms are oriented to the think- ing of the respective drafting parties, the terms contained in them often do not correspond. Often the seller&#8217;s form contains terms different from or addi- tional to those set forth in the buyer&#8217;s form. Nevertheless, the parties proceed with the transaction. [Comment 1 was amended in 1966.]</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Under this Article a proposed deal which in commercial understand- ing has in fact been closed is recognized as a contract. Therefore, any additional matter contained in the confirmation or in the acceptance falls within sub- section (2) and must be regarded as a proposal for an added term unless the acceptance is made conditional on the acceptance of the additional or differ- ent terms. [Comment 2 was amended in 1966.]</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Whether or not additional or different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the provi- sions of subsection (2). If they are such as materially to alter the original bar- gain, they will not be included unless expressly agreed to by the other par- ty. If, however, they are terms which would not so change the bargain they will be incorporated unless notice of ob- jection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>4. Examples of typical clauses which would normally &#8220;materially al- ter&#8221; the contract and so result in sur- prise or hardship if incorporated with- out express awareness by the other party are: a clause negating such stan- dard warranties as that of merchant- ability or fitness for a particular pur- pose in circumstances in which either warranty normally attaches; a clause requiring a guaranty of 90% or 100% deliveries in a case such as a contract by cannery, where the usage of the trade allows greater quantity leeways; a clause reserving to the seller the pow- er to cancel upon the buyer&#8217;s failure to meet any invoice when due; a clause requiring that complaints be made in a time materially shorter than custom- ary or reasonable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Examples of clauses which involve no element of unreasonable surprise and which therefore are to be incorporated in the contract unless notice of objection is seasonably given are: a clause setting forth and perhaps enlarging slightly upon the seller&#8217;s exemption due to supervening causes beyond his control, similar to those covered by the provision of this Article on merchant&#8217;s excuse by failure of pre- supposed conditions or a clause fixing in advance any reasonable formula of proration under such circumstances; a clause fixing a reasonable time for com- plaints within customary limits, or in the case of a purchase for sub-sale, pro- viding for inspection by the sub-pur- chaser; a clause providing for interest on overdue invoices or fixing the sell- er&#8217;s standard credit terms where they are within the range of trade practice and do not limit any credit bargained for; a clause limiting the right of rejec- tion for defects which fall within the customary trade tolerances for accep- tance &#8220;with adjustment&#8221; or otherwise limiting remedy in a reasonable man- ner (see Sections 2&#8211;718 and 2&#8211;719).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. If no answer is received with- in a reasonable time after additional terms are proposed, it is both fair and commercially sound to assume that their inclusion has been assented to. Where clauses on confirming forms sent by both parties conflict each party must be assumed to object to a clause of the other conflicting with one on the confirmation sent by himself. As a result the requirement that there be notice of objection which is found in subsection (2) is satisfied and the con- flicting terms do not become a part of the contract. The contract then consists of the terms originally expressly agreed to, terms on which the confirmations agree, and terms supplied by his Act, including subsection (2). The written confirmation is also subject to Section 2&#8211;201. Under that section a failure to respond permits enforcement of a prior oral agreement; under this section a failure to respond permits additional terms to become part of the agreement. [Comment 6 was amended in 1966.]</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. In many cases, as where goods are shipped, accepted and paid for before any dispute arises, there is no question whether a contract has been made. In such cases, where the writ- ings of the parties do not establish a contract, it is not necessary to deter- mine which act or document constitut- ed the offer and which the acceptance. See Section 2&#8211;204. The only question is what terms are included in the con- tract, and subsection (3) furnishes the governing rule. [Comment 7 was added in 1966.]</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><i>Comment 8 as added in 2022:</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Pursuant to the 2022 Amend- ments, some references in this Article to the terms &#8220;writing,&#8221; &#8220;writings,&#8221; or &#8220;written&#8221; have been changed to refer to a &#8220;record.&#8221; These changes are made in provisions where an affected party may be assumed to have assented to the use of a record that is not a writing. For ex- ample, Section 2&#8211;201 involves a record signed by an affected party and Section 2&#8211;202 refers to a record intended by <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>parties to be a final expression of their agreement. However, in this section and some other sections in this Article refer- ences to these terms remain. Where such references remain in this Article, the use by parties of a record other than a writing may be given effect for purpos- es of this Article under law other than the Uniform Commercial Code, such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7001, et seq., and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.</i></p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section seeks to protect and make effective all necessary and desirable modifications of sales con- tracts without regard to the technicali- ties which at present hamper such ad- justments.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Subsection (1) provides that an agreement modifying a sales con- tract needs no consideration to be bind- ing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">However, modifications made there- under must meet the test of good faith imposed by this Act. The effective use of bad faith to escape performance on the original contract terms is barred, and the extortion of a &#8220;modification&#8221; without legitimate commercial reason is ineffective as a violation of the duty of good faith. Nor can a mere technical consideration support a modification made in bad faith.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The test of &#8220;good faith&#8221; between merchants or as against merchants includes &#8220;observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade&#8221; (Section 2&#8211;103), and may in some situations require an objec- tively demonstrable reason for seeking a modification. But such matters as a market shift which makes performance come to involve a loss may provide such a reason even though there is no such unforeseen difficulty as would make out a legal excuse from performance under Sections 2&#8211;615 and 2&#8211;616.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsections (2) and (3) are intended to protect against false al- legations of oral modifications. &#8220;Modification or rescission&#8221; includes abandonment or other change by mu- tual consent, contrary to the decision in Green v. Doniger, 300 N.Y. 238, 90 N.E.2d 56 (1949); it does not include unilateral &#8220;termination&#8221; or &#8220;cancella- tion&#8221; as defined in Section 2&#8211;106.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The Statute of Frauds provisions of this Article are expressly applied to modifications by subsection (3). Under those provisions the &#8220;delivery and ac- ceptance&#8221; test is limited to the goods which have been accepted, that is, to the past. &#8220;Modification&#8221; for the future cannot therefore be conjured up by oral testimony if the price involved is $500.00 or more since such modifica- tion must be shown at least by an au- thenticated memo. And since a memo is limited in its effect to the quantity of goods set forth in it there is safeguard against oral evidence.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (2) permits the parties in effect to make their own Statute of Frauds as regards any future modifica- tion of the contract by giving effect to a clause in a signed agreement which expressly requires any modification to be by signed writing. But note that if a consumer is to be held to such a clause on a form supplied by a merchant it must be separately signed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Subsection (4) is intended, de- spite the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), to prevent contractual provi- sions excluding modification except by a signed writing from limiting in other respects the legal effect of the parties&#8217; actual later conduct. The effect of such conduct as a waiver is further regulat- ed in subsection (5).</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless other- wise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9&#8211;406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the as- signor&#8217;s due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller&#8217;s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer&#8217;s chance of obtain- ing return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remains effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be pre- vented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of &#8220;the contract&#8221; is to be construed as barring only the delega- tion to the assignee of the assignor&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) An assignment of &#8220;the contract&#8221; or of &#8220;all my rights under the contract&#8221; or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates per- formance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section 2&#8211;609).</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section is intended to make it possible for the courts to po- lice explicitly against the contracts or clauses which they find to be un- conscionable. In the past such polic- ing has been accomplished by adverse construction of language, by manipula- tion of the rules of offer and acceptance or by determinations that the clause is contrary to public policy or to the dominant purpose of the contract. This section is intended to allow the court to pass directly on the unconscionabil- ity of the contract or particular clause therein and to make a conclusion of law as to its unconscionability. The ba- sic test is whether, in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract. Subsection (2) makes it clear that it is proper for the court to hear evidence upon these questions. The principle is one of the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise (Cf. Campbell Soup Co. v. Wentz, 172 F.2d 80, 3d Cir.1948) and not of disturbance of allocation of risks because of superior bargaining power. The underlying basis of this section is illustrated by the results in cases such as the following:</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Kansas City Wholesale Grocery Co. v. Weber Packing Corporation, 93 Utah 414, 73 P.2d 1272 (1937), where a clause limiting time for complaints was held inapplicable to latent defects in a shipment of catsup which could be dis- covered only by microscopic analysis; Hardy v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, 38 Ga.App. 463, 144 S.E. 327 (1928), holding that a disclaimer of warranty clause applied only to ex- press warranties, thus letting in a fair implied warranty; Andrews Bros. v. Singer &amp; Co. (1934 CA) 1 K.B. 17, holding that where a car with substan- tial mileage was delivered instead of a &#8220;new&#8221; car, a disclaimer of warranties, including those &#8220;implied,&#8221; left unaf- fected an &#8220;express obligation&#8221; on the description, even though the Sale of Goods Act called such an implied war- ranty; New Prague Flouring Mill Co. v. G.A. Spears, 194 Iowa 417, 189 N.W. 815 (1922), holding that a clause per- mitting the seller, upon the buyer&#8217;s failure to supply shipping instructions, to cancel, ship, or allow delivery date to be indefinitely postponed 30 days at a time by the inaction, does not indefi- nitely postpone the date of measuring damages for the buyer&#8217;s breach, to the seller&#8217;s advantage; and Kansas Flour Mills Co. v. Dirks, 100 Kan. 376, 164 P. 273 (1917), where under a similar clause in a rising market the court permitted the buyer to measure his damages for non-delivery at the end of only one 30 day postponement; Green v. Arcos, Ltd. (1931 CA) 47 T.L.R. 336, where a blanket clause prohibiting re- jection of shipments by the buyer was restricted to apply to shipments where discrepancies represented merely mer- chantile variations; Meyer v. Packard Cleveland Motor Co., 106 Ohio St. 328, 140 N.E. 118 (1922), in which the court held that a &#8220;waiver&#8221; of all agreements not specified did not preclude implied warranty of fitness of a rebuilt dump truck for ordinary use as a dump truck; Austin Co. v. J.H. Tillman Co., 104 Or. 541, 209 P. 131 (1922), where a clause limiting the buyer&#8217;s remedy to return was held to be applicable only if the seller had delivered a machine needed for a construction job which reasonably met the contract description; Bekkev- old v. Potts, 173 Minn. 87, 216 N.W. 790, 59 A.L.R. 1164 (1927), refusing to allow warranty of fitness for purpose imposed by law to be negated by clause excluding all warranties &#8220;made&#8221; by the seller; Robert A. Munroe &amp; Co. v. Meyer (1930) 2 K.B. 312, holding that the warranty of description overrides a clause reading &#8220;with all faults and de- fects&#8221; where adulterated meat not up to the contract description was delivered.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Under this section the court, in its discretion, may refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is perme- ated by the unconscionability, or it may strike any single clause or group of clauses which are so tainted or which are contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement, or it may simply limit unconscionable clauses so as to avoid unconscionable results.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The present section is ad- dressed to the court, and the decision is to be made by it. The commercial evi- dence referred to in subsection (2) is for the court&#8217;s consideration, not the jury&#8217;s. Only the agreement which results from the court&#8217;s action on these matters is to be submitted to the general triers of the facts.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Sections 9 and 10, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Completely rewritten.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section applies when the price term is left open on the making of an agreement which is nevertheless intended by the parties to be a bind- ing agreement. This Article rejects in these instances the formula that &#8220;an agreement to agree is unenforceable&#8221; if the case falls within subsection (1) of this section, and rejects also defeat- ing such agreements on the ground of &#8220;indefiniteness&#8221;. Instead this Article recognizes the dominant intention of the parties to have the deal continue to be binding upon both. As to future per- formance, since this Article recognizes remedies such as cover (Section 2&#8211;712), resale (Section 2&#8211;706) and specific per- formance (Section 2&#8211;716) which go be- yond any mere arithmetic as between contract price and market price, there is usually a &#8220;reasonably certain basis for granting an appropriate remedy for breach&#8221; so that the contract need not fail for indefiniteness.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Under some circumstances the postponement of agreement on price will mean that no deal has re- ally been concluded, and this is made express in the preamble of subsection (1) (&#8220;The parties if they so intend&#8221;) and in subsection (4). Whether or not this is so is, in most cases, a question to be determined by the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (2), dealing with the situation where the price is to be fixed by one party rejects the uncom- mercial idea that an agreement that the seller may fix the price means that he may fix any price he may wish by the express qualification that the price so fixed must be fixed in good faith. Good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade if the party is a merchant. (Section 2&#8211;103). But in the normal case a &#8220;posted price&#8221; or a future seller&#8217;s or buyer&#8217;s &#8220;given price,&#8221; &#8220;price in effect,&#8221; &#8220;market price,&#8221; or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. The section recognizes that there may be cases in which a partic- ular person&#8217;s judgment is not chosen merely as a barometer or index of a fair price but is an essential condi- tion to the parties&#8217; intent to make any contract at all. For example, the case where a known and trusted expert is to &#8220;value&#8221; a particular painting for which there is no market standard dif- fers sharply from the situation where a named expert is to determine the grade of cotton, and the difference would sup- port a finding that in the one the par- ties did not intend to make a binding agreement if that expert were unavail- able whereas in the other they did so intend. Other circumstances would of course affect the validity of such a find- ing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Under subsection (3), wrong- ful interference by one party with any agreed machinery for price fixing in the contract may be treated by the other party as a repudiation justifying can- cellation, or merely as a failure to take cooperative action thus shifting to the aggrieved party the reasonable leeway in fixing the price.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Throughout the entire sec- tion, the purpose is to give effect to the agreement which has been made. That effect, however, is always conditioned by the requirement of good faith ac- tion which is made an inherent part of all contracts within this Act. (Section 1&#8211;203).</p>

<p class="indent">(2) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (1) of this section, in regard to output and requirements, applies to this specific problem the general approach of this Act which re- quires the reading of commercial back- ground and intent into the language of any agreement and demands good faith in the performance of that agreement. It applies to such contracts of nonpro- ducing establishments such as dealers or distributors as well as to manufac- turing concerns.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Under this Article, a contract for output or requirements is not too in- definite since it is held to mean the ac- tual good faith output or requirements of the particular party. Nor does such a contract lack mutuality of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity is required to operate his plant or conduct his busi- ness in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output or require- ments will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure. Reasonable elastic- ity in the requirements is expressly en- visaged by this section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinu- ance. A shut-down by a requirements buyer for lack of orders might be per- missible when a shut-down merely to curtail losses would not. The essential test is whether the party is acting in good faith. Similarly, a sudden expan- sion of the plant by which require- ments are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the contract as made but normal expan- sion undertaken in good faith would be within the scope of this section. One of the factors in an expansion situation would be whether the market price had risen greatly in a case in which the requirements <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>contract contained a fixed price. Reasonable variation of an ex- treme sort is exemplified in Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma Portland Cement Co., 102 F.2d 630 (C.C.A.10, 1939). This Article takes no position as to whether a requirements contract is a provable claim in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. If an estimate of output or requirements is included in the agree- ment, no quantity unreasonably dis- proportionate to it may be tendered or demanded. Any minimum or maximum set by the agreement shows a clear lim- it on the intended elasticity. In similar fashion, the agreed estimate is to be regarded as a center around which the parties intend the variation to occur.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. When an enterprise is sold, the question may arise whether the buyer is bound by an existing output or requirements contract. That question is outside the scope of this Article, and is to be determined on other principles of law. Assuming that the contract con- tinues, the output or requirements in the hands of the new owner continue to be measured by the actual good faith output or requirements under the nor- mal operation of the enterprise prior to sale. The sale itself is not grounds for sudden expansion or decrease.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Subsection (2), on exclusive dealing, makes explicit the commercial rule embodied in this Act under which the parties to such contracts are held to have impliedly, even when not express- ly, bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract. Under such contracts the exclusive agent is required, although no express commit- ment has been made, to use reasonable effort and due diligence in the expan- sion of the market or the promotion of the product, as the case may be. The principal is expected under such a con- tract to refrain from supplying any oth- er dealer or agent within the exclusive territory. An exclusive dealing agree- ment brings into play all of the good faith aspects of the output and require- ment problems of subsection (1). It also raises questions of insecurity and right to adequate assurance under this Ar- ticle.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (1) requires that all actions taken under a sales contract must be taken within a reasonable time where no time has been agreed upon. The reasonable time under this provi- sion turns on the criteria as to &#8220;rea- sonable time&#8221; and on good faith and commercial standards set forth in Sec- tions 1&#8211;203, 1&#8211;204 and 2&#8211;103. It thus depends upon what constitutes accept- able commercial conduct in view of the nature, purpose and circumstances of the action to be taken. Agreement as to a definite time, however, may be found in a term implied from the contractual circumstances, usage of trade or course of dealing or performance as well as in an express term. Such cases fall out- side of this subsection since in them the time for action is &#8220;agreed&#8221; by usage.</p>

The time for payment, where not agreed upon, is related to the time for delivery; the particular problems which arise in connection with deter- mining the appropriate time of pay- ment and the time for any inspection before payment which is both allowed by law and demanded by the buyer are covered in Section 2&#8211;513.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The facts in regard to ship- ment and delivery differ so widely as to make detailed provision for them in the text of this Article impracticable. The applicable principles, however, make it clear that surprise is to be avoided, good faith judgment is to be protected, and notice or negotiation to reduce the uncertainty to certainty is to be fa- vored.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. When the time for delivery is left open, unreasonably early offers of or demands for delivery are intended to be read under this Article as expres- sions of desire or intention, requesting the assent or acquiescence of the other party, not as final positions which may amount without more to breach or to create breach by the other side. See Sections 2&#8211;207 and 2&#8211;609.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The obligation of good faith under this Act requires reasonable notification before a contract may be treated as breached because a reason- able time for delivery or demand has expired. This operates both in the case of a contract originally indefinite as to time and of one subsequently made in- definite by waiver.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When both parties let an originally reasonable time go by in silence, the course of conduct under the contract may be viewed as enlarging the rea- sonable time for tender or demand of performance. The contract may be ter- minated by abandonment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Parties to a contract are not required in giving reasonable notifica- tion to fix, at peril of breach, a time which is in fact reasonable in the un- foreseeable judgment of a later trier of fact. Effective communication of a pro- posed time limit calls for a response, so that failure to reply will make out acquiescence. Where objection is made, however, or if the demand is merely for information as to when goods will be delivered or will be ordered out, demand for assurances on the ground of insecurity may be made under this Article pending further negotiations. Only when a party insists on undue de- lay or on rejection of the other party&#8217;s reasonable proposal is there a question of flat breach under the present sec- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Subsection (2) applies a com- mercially reasonable view to resolve the conflict which has arisen in the cases as to contracts of indefinite dura- tion. The &#8220;reasonable time&#8221; of duration appropriate to a given arrangement is limited by the circumstances. When the arrangement has been carried on by the parties over the years, the &#8220;rea- sonable time&#8221; can continue indefinitely and the contract will not terminate un- til notice.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. Subsection (3) recognizes that the application of principles of good faith and sound commercial practice normally call for such notification of the termination of a going contract re- lationship as will give the other party reasonable time to seek a substitute ar- rangement. An agreement dispensing with notification or limiting the time for the seeking of a substitute arrange- ment is, of course, valid under this sub- section unless the results of putting it into operation would be the creation of an unconscionable state of affairs.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Justifiable cancellation for breach is a remedy for breach and is not the kind of termination covered by the present subsection.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. The requirement of notifi- cation is dispensed with where the contract provides for termination on the happening of an &#8220;agreed event.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>&#8220;Event&#8221; is a term chosen here to con- trast with &#8220;option&#8221; or the like.</p>

<p class="indent1">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Rewritten.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes: To consoli- date and systematize basic prin- ciples with the result that:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. &#8220;Express&#8221; warranties rest on &#8220;dickered&#8221; aspects of the individual bargain, and go so clearly to the es- sence of that bargain that words of disclaimer in a form are repugnant to the basic dickered terms. &#8220;Implied&#8221; warranties rest so clearly on a common factual situation or set of conditions that no particular language or action is necessary to evidence them and they will arise in such a situation unless un- mistakably negated.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This section reverts to the older case law insofar as the warranties of description and sample are designated &#8220;express&#8221; rather than &#8220;implied&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Although this section is lim- ited in its scope and direct purpose to warranties made by the seller to the buyer as part of a contract for sale, the warranty sections of this Article are not designed in any way to disturb those lines of case law growth which have recognized that warranties need not be confined either to sales con- tracts or to the direct parties to such a contract. They may arise in other appropriate circumstances such as in the case of bailments for hire, whether such bailment is itself the main con- tract or is merely a supplying of con- tainers under a contract for the sale of their contents. The provisions of Sec- tion 2&#8211;318 on third party beneficiaries <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>expressly recognize this case law devel- opment within one particular area. Be- yond that, the matter is left to the case law with the intention that the policies of this Act may offer useful guidance in dealing with further cases as they arise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The present section deals with affirmations of fact by the seller, de- scriptions of the goods or exhibitions of samples, exactly as any other part of a negotiation which ends in a contract is dealt with. No specific intention to make a warranty is necessary if any of these factors is made part of the basis of the bargain. In actual practice affir- mations of fact made by the seller about the goods during a bargain are regard- ed as part of the description of those goods; hence no particular reliance on such statements need be shown in or- der to weave them into the fabric of the agreement. Rather, any fact which is to take such affirmations, once made, out of the agreement requires clear af- firmative proof. The issue normally is one of fact.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. In view of the principle that the whole purpose of the law of war- ranty is to determine what it is that the seller has in essence agreed to sell, the policy is adopted of those cases which refuse except in unusual circumstances to recognize a material deletion of the seller&#8217;s obligation. Thus, a contract is normally a contract for a sale of some- thing describable and described. A clause generally disclaiming &#8220;all war- ranties, express or implied&#8221; cannot re- duce the seller&#8217;s obligation with respect to such description and therefore can- not be given literal effect under Section 2&#8211;316.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This is not intended to mean that the parties, if they consciously desire, cannot make their own bargain as they wish. But in determining what they have agreed upon good faith is a fac- tor and consideration should be given to the fact that the probability is small that a real price is intended to be ex- changed for a pseudo-obligation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Paragraph (1)(b) makes specif- ic some of the principles set forth above when a description of the goods is given by the seller.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A description need not be by words. Technical specifications, blueprints and the like can afford more exact de- scription than mere language and if made part of the basis of the bargain goods must conform with them. Past deliveries may set the description of quality, either expressly or impliedly by course of dealing. Of course, all de- scriptions by merchants must be read against the applicable trade usages with the general rules as to merchant- ability resolving any doubts.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The basic situation as to state- ments affecting the true essence of the bargain is no different when a sample or model is involved in the transaction. This section includes both a &#8220;sample&#8221; actually drawn from the bulk of goods which is the subject matter of the sale, and a &#8220;model&#8221; which is offered for in- spection when the subject matter is not at hand and which has not been drawn from the bulk of the goods.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Although the underlying principles are unchanged, the facts are often am- biguous when something is shown as illustrative, rather than as a straight sample. In general, the presump- tion is that any sample or model just as any affirmation of fact is intended to become a basis of the bargain. But there is no escape from the question of fact. When the seller exhibits a sample purporting to be drawn from an exist- ing bulk, good faith of course requires that the sample be fairly drawn. But in mercantile experience the mere ex- hibition of a &#8220;sample&#8221; does not of itself show whether it is merely intended to &#8220;suggest&#8221; or to &#8220;be&#8221; the character of the subject-matter of the contract. The question is whether the seller has so acted with reference to the sample <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>as to make him responsible that the whole shall have at least the values shown by it. The circumstances aid in answering this question. If the sample has been drawn from an existing bulk, it must be regarded as describing val- ues of the goods contracted for unless it is accompanied by an unmistakable denial of such responsibility. If, on the other hand, a model of merchandise not on hand is offered, the mercantile pre- sumption that it has become a literal description of the subject matter is not so strong, and particularly so if modifi- cation on the buyer&#8217;s initiative impairs any feature of the model.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The precise time when words of description or affirmation are made or samples are shown is not material. The sole question is whether the lan- guage or samples or models are fairly to be regarded as part of the contract. If language is used after the closing of the deal (as when the buyer when tak- ing delivery asks and receives an ad- ditional assurance), the warranty be- comes a modification, and need not be supported by consideration if it is oth- erwise reasonable and in order (Section 2&#8211;209).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. Concerning affirmations of value or a seller&#8217;s opinion or commen- dation under subsection (2), the ba- sic question remains the same: What statements of the seller have in the circumstances and in objective judg- ment become part of the basis of the bargain? As indicated above, all of the statements of the seller do so unless good reason is shown to the contrary. The provisions of subsection (2) are in- cluded, however, since common experi- ence discloses that some statements or predictions cannot fairly be viewed as entering into the bargain. Even as to false statements of value, however, the possibility is left open that a remedy may be provided by the law relating to fraud or misrepresentation.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Section 15(2), Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Completely rewritten.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b> This section, drawn in view of the steadily develop- ing case law on the subject, is intended to make it clear that:</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The seller&#8217;s obligation applies to present sales as well as to contracts to sell subject to the effects of any ex- amination of specific goods. (Subsec- tion (2) of Section 2&#8211;316). Also, the warranty of merchantability applies to sales for use as well as to sales for re- sale.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The question when the war- ranty is imposed turns basically on the meaning of the terms of the agreement as recognized in the trade. Goods de- livered under an agreement made by a merchant in a given line of trade must be of a quality comparable to that gen- erally acceptable in that line of trade under the description or other desig- nation of the goods used in the agree- ment. The responsibility imposed rests on any merchant-seller, and the ab- sence of the words &#8220;grower or manufac- turer or not&#8221; which appeared in Section 15(2) of the Uniform Sales Act does not restrict the applicability of this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A specific designation of goods by the buyer does not exclude the seller&#8217;s obligation that they be fit for the general purposes appropriate to such goods. A contract for the sale of second-hand goods, however, involves only such obligation as is appropriate to such goods for that is their contract description. A person making an iso- lated sale of goods is not a &#8220;merchant&#8221; within the meaning of the full scope of this section and, thus, no warranty of merchantability would apply. His knowledge of any defects not apparent on inspection would, however, with- out need for express agreement and in keeping with the underlying reason of the present section and the provisions on good faith, impose an obligation that known material but hidden defects be fully disclosed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Although a seller may not be a &#8220;merchant&#8221; as to the goods in ques- tion, if he states generally that they are &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; the provisions of this section may furnish a guide to the con- tent of the resulting express warranty. This has particular significance in the case of second-hand sales, and has fur- ther significance in limiting the effect of fine-print disclaimer clauses where their effect would be inconsistent with large-print assertions of &#8220;guarantee&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The second sentence of sub- section (1) covers the warranty with respect to food and drink. Serving food or drink for value is a sale, whether to be consumed on the premises or elsewhere. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Cases to the contrary are re- jected. The principal warranty is that stated in subsections (1) and (2)(c) of this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Subsection (2) does not pur- port to exhaust the meaning of &#8220;mer- chantable&#8221; nor to negate any of its at- tributes not specifically mentioned in the text of the statute, but arising by usage of trade or through case law. The language used is &#8220;must be at least such as &#8230;,&#8221; and the intention is to leave open other possible attributes of mer- chantability.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub- section (2) are to be read together. Both refer, as indicated above, to the stan- dards of that line of the trade which fits the transaction and the seller&#8217;s business. &#8220;Fair average&#8221; is a term di- rectly appropriate to agricultural bulk products and means goods center- ing around the middle belt of quality, not the least or the worst that can be understood in the particular trade by the designation, but such as can pass &#8220;without objection.&#8221; Of course a fair percentage of the least is permissible but the goods are not &#8220;fair average&#8221; if they are all of the least or worst quality possible under the description. In cases of doubt as to what quality is intended, the price at which a merchant closes a contract is an excellent index of the na- ture and scope of his obligation under the present section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. Fitness for the ordinary pur- poses for which goods of the type are used is a fundamental concept of the present section and is covered in para- graph (c). As stated above, merchant- ability is also a part of the obligation owing to the purchaser for use. Corre- spondingly, protection, under this as- pect of the warranty, of the person buy- ing for resale to the ultimate consumer is equally necessary, and merchantable goods must therefore be &#8220;honestly&#8221; re- salable in the normal course of busi- ness because they are what they pur- port to be.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Paragraph (d) on evenness of kind, quality and quantity follows case law. But precautionary language has been added as a remainder of the frequent usages of trade which permit substantial variations both with and without an allowance or an obligation to replace the varying units.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. Paragraph (e) applies only where the nature of the goods and of the transaction require a certain type of container, package or label. Paragraph (f) applies, on the other hand, wherever there is a label or container on which representations are made, even though the original contract, either by express terms or usage of trade, may not have required either the labelling or the representation. This follows from the general obligation of good faith which requires that a buyer should not be placed in the position of reselling or using goods delivered under false rep- resentations appearing on the pack- age or container. No problem of extra consideration arises in this connection since, under this Article, an obligation is imposed by the original contract not to deliver mislabeled articles, and the obligation is imposed where mercantile good faith so requires and without ref- erence to the doctrine of consideration.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. Exclusion or modification of the warranty of merchantability, or of any part of it, is dealt with in the sec- tion to which the text of the present section makes explicit precautionary references. That section must be read with particular reference to its subsec- tion (4) on limitation of remedies. The warranty of merchantability, wherever it is normal, is so commonly taken for granted that its exclusion from the con- tract is a matter threatening surprise and therefore requiring special precau- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. Subsection (3) is to make ex- plicit that usage of trade and course <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of dealing can create warranties and that they are implied rather than ex- press warranties and thus subject to exclusion or modification under Section 2&#8211;316. A typical instance would be the obligation to provide pedigree papers to evidence conformity of the animal to the contract in the case of a pedigreed dog or blooded bull.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. In an action based on breach of warranty, it is of course necessary to show not only the existence of the war- ranty but the fact that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty was the proximate cause of the loss sustained. In such an action an affirmative showing by the seller that the loss resulted from some action or event following his own delivery of the goods can operate as a defense. Equal- ly, evidence indicating that the seller exercised care in the manufacture, processing or selection of the goods is relevant to the issue of whether the warranty was in fact broken. Action by the buyer following an examination of the goods which ought to have indi- cated the defect complained of can be shown as matter bearing on whether the breach itself was the cause of the injury.</p>

<p class="noindent">Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any par- ticular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller&#8217;s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Rewritten.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Whether or not this warranty arises in any individual case is basical- ly a question of fact to be determined by the circumstances of the contract- ing. Under this section the buyer need not bring home to the seller actual knowledge of the particular purpose for which the goods are intended or of his reliance on the seller&#8217;s skill and judg- ment, if the circumstances are such that the seller has reason to realize the purpose intended or that the reliance exists. The buyer, of course, must actu- ally be relying on the seller.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A &#8220;particular purpose&#8221; differs from the ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it envisages a specific use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business whereas the ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envis- aged in the concept of merchantability and go to uses which are customar- ily made of the goods in question. For example, shoes are generally used for the purpose of walking upon ordinary <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>ground, but a seller may know that a particular pair was selected to be used for climbing mountains.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A contract may of course include both a warranty of merchantability and one of fitness for a particular pur- pose.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The provisions of this Article on the cumulation and conflict of express and implied warranties must be consid- ered on the question of inconsistency between or among warranties. In such a case any question of fact as to which warranty was intended by the parties to apply must be resolved in favor of the warranty of fitness for particular purpose as against all other warranties except where the buyer has taken upon himself the responsibility of furnishing the technical specifications.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. In connection with the war- ranty of fitness for a particular pur- pose the provisions of this Article on the allocation or division of risks are particularly applicable in any trans- action in which the purpose for which the goods are to be used combines re- quirements both as to the quality of the goods themselves and compliance with certain laws or regulations. How the risks are divided is a question of fact to be determined, where not expressly contained in the agreement, from the circumstances of contracting, usage of trade, course of performance and the like, matters which may constitute the &#8220;otherwise agreement&#8221; of the parties by which they may divide the risk or bur- den.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. The absence from this section of the language used in the Uniform Sales Act in referring to the seller, &#8220;whether he be the grower or manu- facturer or not,&#8221; is not intended to im- pose any requirement that the seller be a grower or manufacturer. Although normally the warranty will arise only where the seller is a merchant with the appropriate &#8220;skill or judgment,&#8221; it can arise as to non-merchants where this is justified by the particular circumstanc- es.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The elimination of the &#8220;patent or other trade name&#8221; exception consti- tutes the major extension of the war- ranty of fitness which has been made by the cases and continued in this Ar- ticle. Under the present section the ex- istence of a patent or other trade name and the designation of the article by that name, or indeed in any other defi- nite manner, is only one of the facts to be considered on the question of wheth- er the buyer actually relied on the sell- er, but it is not of itself decisive of the issue. If the buyer himself is insisting on a particular brand he is not relying on the seller&#8217;s skill and judgment and so no warranty results. But the mere fact that the article purchased has a particular patent or trade name is not sufficient to indicate nonreliance if the article has been recommended by the seller as adequate for the buyer&#8217;s pur- poses.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The specific reference forward in the present section to the following section on exclusion or modification of warranties is to call attention to the possibility of eliminating the warranty in any given case. However it must be noted that under the following section the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose must be excluded or modified by a conspicuous writing.</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied war- ranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to ex- clude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None. See sections 15 and 71, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section is designed prin- cipally to deal with those frequent clauses in sales contracts which seek to exclude &#8220;all warranties, express or im- plied.&#8221; It seeks to protect a buyer from unexpected and unbargained language of disclaimer by denying effect to such language when inconsistent with lan- guage of express warranty and permit- ting the exclusion of implied warran- ties only by conspicuous language or other circumstances which protect the buyer from surprise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The seller is protected under this Article against false allegations of oral warranties by its provisions on parol and extrinsic evidence and against unauthorized representations by the customary &#8220;lack of authority&#8221; clauses. This Article treats the limita- tion or avoidance of consequential dam- ages as a matter of limiting remedies <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>for breach, separate from the matter of creation of liability under a warranty. If no warranty exists, there is of course no problem of limiting remedies for breach of warranty. Under subsection (4) the question of limitation of remedy is governed by the sections referred to rather than by this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Disclaimer of the implied war- ranty of merchantability is permit- ted under subsection (2), but with the safeguard that such disclaimers must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Unlike the implied warranty of merchantability, implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose may be excluded by general language, but only if it is in writing and conspicuous.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Subsection (2) presupposes that the implied warranty in question exists unless excluded or modified. Whether or not language of disclaimer satisfies the requirements of this sec- tion, such language may be relevant under other sections to the question whether the warranty was ever in fact created. Thus, unless the provisions of this Article on parol and extrinsic evidence prevent, oral language of dis- claimer may raise issues of fact as to whether reliance by the buyer occurred and whether the seller had &#8220;reason to know&#8221; under the section on implied warranty of fitness for a particular pur- pose.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. The exceptions to the general rule set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (3) are common factual situations in which the circumstances surrounding the transaction are in themselves sufficient to call the buyer&#8217;s attention to the fact that no implied warranties are made or that a certain implied warranty is being excluded.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Paragraph (a) of subsection (3) deals with general terms such as &#8220;as is,&#8221; &#8220;as they stand,&#8221; &#8220;with all faults,&#8221; and the like. Such terms in ordinary com- mercial usage are understood to mean that the buyer takes the entire risk as to the quality of the goods involved. The terms covered by paragraph (a) are in fact merely a particularization of paragraph (c) which provides for exclu- sion or modification of implied warran- ties by usage of trade.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. Under paragraph (b) of sub- section (3) warranties may be exclud- ed or modified by the circumstances where the buyer examines the goods or a sample or model of them before entering into the contract. &#8220;Examina- tion&#8221; as used in this paragraph is not synonymous with inspection before ac- ceptance or at any other time after the contract has been made. It goes rather to the nature of the responsibility as- sumed by the seller at the time of the making of the contract. Of course if the buyer discovers the defect and uses the goods anyway, or if he unreason- ably fails to examine the goods before he uses them, resulting injuries may be found to result from his own action rather than proximately from a breach of warranty. See Sections 2&#8211;314 and 2&#8211;715 and comments thereto.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In order to bring the transaction within the scope of &#8220;refused to exam- ine&#8221; in paragraph (b), it is not suffi- cient that the goods are available for inspection. There must in addition be a demand by the seller that the buyer examine the goods fully. The seller by the demand puts the buyer on notice that he is assuming the risk of defects which the examination ought to reveal. The language &#8220;refused to examine&#8221; in this paragraph is intended to make clear the necessity for such demand.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Application of the doctrine of &#8220;cave- at emptor&#8221; in all cases where the buyer examines the goods regardless of state- ments made by the seller is, however, rejected by this Article. Thus, if the of- fer of examination is accompanied by words as to their merchantability or specific attributes and the buyer indi- cates clearly that he is relying on those <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>words rather than on his examination, they give rise to an &#8220;express&#8221; warranty. In such cases the question is one of fact as to whether a warranty of merchant- ability has been expressly incorporated in the agreement. Disclaimer of such an express warranty is governed by subsection (1) of the present section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The particular buyer&#8217;s skill and the normal method of examining goods in the circumstances determine what de- fects are excluded by the examination. A failure to notice defects which are obvious cannot excuse the buyer. How- ever, an examination under circum- stances which do not permit chemical or other testing of the goods would not exclude defects which could be ascer- tained only by such testing. Nor can latent defects be excluded by a simple examination. A professional buyer ex- amining a product in his field will be held to have assumed the risk as to all defects which a professional in the field ought to observe, while a nonpro- fessional buyer will be held to have as- sumed the risk only for such defects as a layman might be expected to observe.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. The situation in which the buyer gives precise and complete speci- fications to the seller is not explicitly covered in this section, but this is a frequent circumstance by which the implied warranties may be excluded. The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose would not normally arise since in such a situation there is usually no reliance on the seller by the buyer. The warranty of merchantability in such a transaction, however, must be considered in connection with the next section on the cumulation and conflict of warranties. Under paragraph (c) of that section in case of such an incon- sistency the implied warranty of mer- chantability is displaced by the express warranty that the goods will comply with the specifications. Thus, where the buyer gives detailed specifications as to the goods, neither of the implied warranties as to quality will normally apply to the transaction unless consis- tent with the specifications.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The last sentence of this sec- tion does not mean that a seller is precluded from excluding or disclaim- ing a warranty which might otherwise arise in connection with the sale pro- vided such exclusion or modification is permitted by Section 2&#8211;316. Nor does that sentence preclude the seller from limiting the remedies of his own buyer and of any beneficiaries, in any manner provided in Sections 2&#8211;718 or 2&#8211;719. To the extent that the contract of sale contains provisions under which warranties are excluded or modified, or remedies for breach are limited, such provisions are equally operative against beneficiaries of warranties under this section. What this last sen- tence forbids is exclusion of liability by the seller to the persons to whom the warranties which he has made to his buyer would extend under this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The purpose of this section is to give certain beneficiaries the benefit of the same warranty which the buyer <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>received in the contract of sale, thereby freeing any such beneficiaries from any technical rules as to &#8220;privity.&#8221; It seeks to accomplish this purpose without any derogation of any right or remedy rest- ing on negligence. It rests primarily upon the merchant-seller&#8217;s warranty under this Article that the goods sold are merchantable and fit for the ordi- nary purposes for which such goods are used rather than the warranty of fit- ness for a particular purpose. Implicit in the section is that any beneficiary of a warranty may bring a direct action for breach of warranty against the sell- er whose warranty extends to him [As amended in 1966].</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The first alternative express- ly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser. Beyond this, the section in this form is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing case law on whether the seller&#8217;s warranties, given to his buyer who resells, extend to other persons in the distributive chain. The second al- ternative is designed for states where the case law has already developed further and for those that desire to expand the class of beneficiaries. The third alternative goes further, follow- ing the trend of modern decisions as indicated by Restatement of Torts 2d &#167; 402A (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1965) in extending the rule beyond injuries to the person.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the sub- ject of a separate sale.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auc- tioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer&#8217;s announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder&#8217;s retraction does not revive any previous bid.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller&#8217;s behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been giv- en that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.</p>

<p class="noindent">Each provision of this Article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this Article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (Section 2&#8211;501), and unless otherwise ex- plicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special prop- erty as limited by this Act. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with refer- ence to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destina- tion, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods,</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such docu- ments and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance re- vests title to the goods in the seller.

<p class="indent">(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest ac- quires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of pur- chase the purchaser has such power even though</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a &#8220;cash sale&#8221;, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larce- nous under the criminal law.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) &#8220;Entrusting&#8221; includes any delivery and any acquiescence in re- tention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor&#8217;s disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the Articles on Secured Transactions (Article 9), Bulk Trans- fers (Article 6) and Documents of Title (Article 7).</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2&#8211;501. Insurable Interest in Goods; Manner of Identification of Goods</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are non-conforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or other- wise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2&#8211;503. Manner of Seller&#8217;s Tender of Delivery</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conform- ing goods at the buyer&#8217;s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this Article, and in particular</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities rea- sonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any ap- propriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be deliv- ered without being moved</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable docu- ment of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer&#8217;s right to possession of the goods; but</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in Article 9 receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer&#8217;s rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direc- tion, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) he must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this Article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsec- tion (2) of Section 2&#8211;323); and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His pro- curement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller&#8217;s expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) a non-negotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee re- serves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of con- ditional delivery (subsection (2) of Section 2&#8211;507) a non-negotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lad- ing.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security inter- est is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper con- tract for transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller&#8217;s powers as a holder of a negotiable docu- ment of title.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (1) permits a seller who has made a non-conforming ten- der in any case to make a conforming delivery within the contract time upon <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>seasonable notification to the buyer. It applies even where the seller has taken back the non-conforming goods and re- funded the purchase price. He may still make a good tender within the contract period. The closer, however, it is to the contract date, the greater is the neces- sity for extreme promptness on the seller&#8217;s part in notifying of his inten- tion to cure, if such notification is to be &#8220;seasonable&#8221; under this subsection.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The rule of this subsection, more- over, is qualified by its underlying rea- sons. Thus if, after contracting for June delivery, a buyer later makes known to the seller his need for shipment early in the month and the seller ships ac- cordingly, the &#8220;contract time&#8221; has been cut down by the supervening modifi- cation and the time for cure of tender must be referred to this modified time term.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Subsection (2) seeks to avoid injustice to the seller by reason of a surprise rejection by the buyer. How- ever, the seller is not protected unless he had &#8220;reasonable grounds to believe&#8221; that the tender would be acceptable. Such reasonable grounds can lie in prior course of dealing, course of per- formance or usage of trade as well as in the particular circumstances sur- rounding the making of the contract. The seller is charged with commercial knowledge of any factors in a particu- lar sales situation which require him to comply strictly with his obligations un- der the contract as, for example, strict conformity of documents in an overseas shipment or the sale of precision parts or chemicals for use in manufacture. Further, if the buyer gives notice ei- ther implicitly, as by a prior course of dealing involving rigorous inspections, or expressly, as by the deliberate inclu- sion of a &#8220;no replacement&#8221; clause in the contract, the seller is to be held to rigid compliance. If the clause appears in a &#8220;form&#8221; contract evidence that it is out of line with trade usage or the prior course of dealing and was not called to the seller&#8217;s attention may be sufficient to show that the seller had reason- able grounds to believe that the tender would be acceptable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The words &#8220;a further reason- able time to substitute a conforming tender&#8221; are intended as words of limi- tation to protect the buyer. What is a &#8220;reasonable time&#8221; depends upon the attending circumstances. Compare Section 2&#8211;511 on the comparable case of a seller&#8217;s surprise demand for legal tender.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Existing trade usages permit- ting variations without rejection but with price allowance enter into the agreement itself as contractual limita- tions of remedy and are not covered by this section.</p>

Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.</p>

<p class="indent">(5) Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obliga- tion for which his seller is answerable over</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) he may give his seller written notice of the litigation.

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> See Sections 53, 54(1)(b), 55 and 63(2), Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The section rests on the recog- nition of the fact that the essential pur- pose of a contract between commercial men is actual performance and they do not bargain merely for a promise, or for a promise plus the right to win a law- suit and that a continuing sense of re- liance and security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due, is an important feature of the bar- gain. If either the willingness or the ability of a party to perform declines materially between the time of con- tracting and the time for performance, the other party is threatened with the loss of a substantial part of what he has bargained for. A seller needs protection not merely against having to deliver on credit to a shaky buyer, but also against having to procure and manufacture the goods, perhaps turn- ing down other customers. Once he has been given reason to believe that the buyer&#8217;s performance has become uncer- tain, it is an undue hardship to force him to continue his own performance. Similarly, a buyer who believes that the seller&#8217;s deliveries have become un- certain cannot safely wait for the due date of performance when he has been buying to assure himself of materials for his current manufacturing or to re- plenish his stock of merchandise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Three measures have been ad- opted to meet the needs of commercial men in such situations. First, the ag- grieved party is permitted to suspend his own performance and any prepa- ration therefor, with excuse for any resulting necessary delay, until the situation has been clarified. &#8220;Suspend performance&#8221; under this section means to hold up performance pending the outcome of the demand, and includes also the holding up of any prepara- tory action. This is the same principle which governs the ancient law of stop- page and seller&#8217;s lien, and also of ex- cuse of a buyer from prepayment if the seller&#8217;s actions manifest that he cannot or will not perform. (Original Act, Sec- tion 63(2).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Secondly, the aggrieved party is given the right to require adequate as- surance that the other party&#8217;s perfor- mance will be duly forthcoming. This principle is reflected in the familiar clauses permitting the seller to curtail deliveries if the buyer&#8217;s credit becomes impaired, which when held within the limits of reasonableness and good faith actually express no more than the fair business meaning of any commercial contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, and finally, this section pro- vides the means by which the aggrieved party may treat the contract as broken if his reasonable grounds for insecurity are not cleared up within a reasonable time. This is the principle underlying the law of anticipatory breach, whether by way of defective part performance or by repudiation. The present section merges these three principles of law and commercial practice into a single theory of general application to all sales agreements looking to future per- formance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (2) of the pres- ent section requires that &#8220;reasonable&#8221; grounds and &#8220;adequate&#8221; assurance as used in subsection (1) be defined by commercial rather than legal stan- dards. The express reference to commercial <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>standards carries no connota- tion that the obligation of good faith is not equally applicable here.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under commercial standards and in accord with commercial practice, a ground for insecurity need not arise from or be directly related to the con- tract in question. The law as to &#8220;depen- dence&#8221; or &#8220;independence&#8221; of promises within a single contract does not con- trol the application of the present sec- tion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Thus a buyer who falls behind in &#8220;his account&#8221; with the seller, even though the items involved have to do with separate and legally distinct con- tracts, impairs the seller&#8217;s expectation of due performance. Again, under the same test, a buyer who requires pre- cision parts which he intends to use immediately upon delivery, may have reasonable grounds for insecurity if he discovers that his seller is making de- fective deliveries of such parts to other buyers with similar needs. Thus, too, in a situation such as arose in Jay Dreher Corporation v. Delco Appliance Corpo- ration, 93 F.2d 275 (C.C.A. 2, 1937), where a manufacturer gave a dealer an exclusive franchise for the sale of his product but on two or three occasions breached the exclusive dealing clause, although there was no default in or- ders, deliveries or payments under the separate sales contract between the parties, the aggrieved dealer would be entitled to suspend his performance of the contract for sale under the present section and to demand assurance that the exclusive dealing contract would be lived up to. There is no need for an explicit clause tying the exclusive fran- chise into the contract for the sale of goods since the situation itself ties the agreements together.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The nature of the sales contract enters also into the question of reason- ableness. For example, a report from an apparently trustworthy source that the seller had shipped defective goods or was planning to ship them would normally give the buyer reasonable grounds for insecurity. But when the buyer has assumed the risk of payment before inspection of the goods, as in a sales contract on C.I.F. or similar cash against documents terms, that risk is not to be evaded by a demand for assur- ance. Therefore no ground for insecu- rity would exist under this section un- less the report went to a ground which would excuse payment by the buyer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. What constitutes &#8220;adequate&#8221; assurance of due performance is sub- ject to the same test of factual condi- tions. For example, where the buyer can make use of a defective delivery, a mere promise by a seller of good re- pute that he is giving the matter his at- tention and that the defect will not be repeated, is normally sufficient. Under the same circumstances, however, a similar statement by a known corner- cutter might well be considered insuf- ficient without the posting of a guar- anty or, if so demanded by the buyer, a speedy replacement of the delivery involved. By the same token where a delivery has defects, even though eas- ily curable, which interfere with easy use by the buyer, no verbal assurance can be deemed adequate which is not accompanied by replacement, repair, money-allowance, or other commercial- ly reasonable cure.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A fact situation such as arose in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Fasola, 94 N.J.L. 181, 109 A. 505 (1920) offers illustration both of reasonable grounds for insecurity and &#8220;adequate&#8221; assur- ance. In that case a contract for the sale of oils on 30 days&#8217; credit, 2% off for payment within-10 days, provided that credit was to be extended to the buyer only if his financial responsibil- ity was satisfactory to the seller. The buyer had been in the habit of taking advantage of the discount but at the same time that he failed to make his customary 10 day payment, the seller heard rumors, in fact false, that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>buyer&#8217;s financial condition was shaky. Thereupon, the seller demanded cash before shipment or security satisfacto- ry to him. The buyer sent a good credit report from his banker, expressed will- ingness to make payments when due on the 30 day terms and insisted on further deliveries under the contract. Under this Article the rumors, al- though false, were enough to make the buyer&#8217;s financial condition &#8220;unsatisfac- tory&#8221; to the seller under the contract clause. Moreover, the buyer&#8217;s practice of taking the cash discounts is enough, apart from the contract clause, to lay a commercial foundation for suspicion when the practice is suddenly stopped. These matters, however, go only to the justification of the seller&#8217;s demand for security, or his &#8220;reasonable grounds for insecurity&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The adequacy of the assurance given is not measured as in the type of &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; situation affected with intangibles, such as in personal service cases, cases involving a third party&#8217;s judgment as final, or cases in which the whole contract is dependent on one party&#8217;s satisfaction, as in a sale on ap- proval. Here, the seller must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards. This Article thus approves the statement of the court in James B. Berry&#8217;s Sons Co. of Illinois v. Monark Gasoline &amp; Oil Co., Inc., 32 F.2d 74 (C.C.A.8, 1929), that the seller&#8217;s sat- isfaction under such a clause must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary or capricious; and rejects the purely personal &#8220;good faith&#8221; test of the Corn Products Refining Co. case, which held that in the seller&#8217;s sole judgment, if for any reason he was dissatisfied, he was entitled to revoke the credit. In the absence of the buyer&#8217;s failure to take the 2% discount as was his custom, the banker&#8217;s report given in that case would have been &#8220;adequate&#8221; assurance under this Act, regardless of the lan- guage of the &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; clause. How- ever, the seller is reasonably entitled to feel insecure at a sudden expansion of the buyer&#8217;s use of a credit term, and should be entitled either to security or to a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The entire foregoing discussion as to adequacy of assurance by way of explanation is subject to qualification when repeated occasions for the ap- plication of this section arise. This Act recognizes that repeated delinquencies must be viewed as cumulative. On the other hand, commercial sense also re- quires that if repeated claims for assur- ance are made under this section, the basis for these claims must be increas- ingly obvious.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A failure to provide adequate assurance of performance and thereby to re-establish the security of expecta- tion, results in a breach only &#8220;by repu- diation&#8221; under subsection (4). There- fore, the possibility is continued of retraction of the repudiation under the section dealing with that problem, un- less the aggrieved party has acted on the breach in some manner.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The thirty day limit on the time to provide assurance is laid down to free the question of reasonable time from uncertainty in later litigation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Clauses seeking to give the protected party exceedingly wide pow- ers to cancel or readjust the contract when ground for insecurity arises must be read against the fact that good faith is a part of the obligation of the con- tract and not subject to modification by agreement and includes, in the case of a merchant, the reasonable observance of commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. Such clauses can thus be effective to enlarge the protection given by the present section to a certain ex- tent, to fix the reasonable time within which requested assurance must be given, or to define adequacy of the as- surance in any commercially reason- able fashion. But any clause seeking to set up arbitrary standards for action is ineffective under this Article. Acceleration <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>clauses are treated similarly in the Articles on Commercial Paper and Se- cured Transactions.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. With the problem of insecurity taken care of by the preceding section and with provision being made in this Article as to the effect of a defective de- livery under an installment contract, anticipatory repudiation centers upon an overt communication of intention or an action which renders performance impossible or demonstrates a clear de- termination not to continue with per- formance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under the present section when such a repudiation substantially im- pairs the value of the contract, the ag- grieved party may at any time resort to his remedies for breach, or he may suspend his own performance while he negotiates with, or awaits performance by, the other party. But if he awaits performance beyond a commercially reasonable time he cannot recover re- sulting damages which he should have avoided.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. It is not necessary for repudia- tion that performance be made literal- ly and utterly impossible. Repudiation can result from action which reasonably <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>indicates a rejection of the con- tinuing obligation. And, a repudiation automatically results under the preced- ing section on insecurity when a party fails to provide adequate assurance of due future performance within thirty days after a justifiable demand there- for has been made. Under the language of this section, a demand by one or both parties for more than the contract calls for in the way of counter-performance is not in itself a repudiation nor does it invalidate a plain expression of desire for future performance. However, when under a fair reading it amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract, it becomes a repudiation.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2&#8211;611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Until the repudiating party&#8217;s next performance is due he can re- tract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this Article (Section 2&#8211;609).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party&#8217;s rights under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.</p>

<p class="indent">(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past install- ments or demands performance as to future installments.</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section excuses a seller from timely delivery of goods contracted for, where his performance has become commercially impracticable because of unforeseen supervening circumstances not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. The destruction of specific goods and the problem of the use of substituted per- formance on points other than delay or quantity, treated elsewhere in this Article, must be distinguished from the matter covered by this section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The present section delib- erately refrains from any effort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies and is to be interpreted in all cases sought to be brought within its scope in terms of its underlying reason and purpose.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The first test for excuse under this Article in terms of basic assump- tion is a familiar one. The additional test of commercial impracticability (as contrasted with &#8220;impossibility,&#8221; &#8220;frus- tration of performance&#8221; or &#8220;frustration of the venture&#8221;) has been adopted in order to call attention to the commer- cial character of the criterion chosen by this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contin- gency which alters the essential nature of the performance. Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market in itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk which business contracts made at fixed prices are in- tended to cover. But a severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency such as war, embargo, lo- cal crop failure unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether prevents the seller <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>from securing supplies necessary to his performance, is within the contempla- tion of this section. (See Ford &amp; Sons, Ltd. v. Henry Leetham &amp; Sons, Ltd., 21 Com.Cas. 55 (1915, K.B.D.).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Where a particular source of supply is exclusive under the agree- ment and fails through casualty, the present section applies rather than the provision on destruction or deteriora- tion of specific goods. The same holds true where a particular source of sup- ply is shown by the circumstances to have been contemplated or assumed by the parties at the time of contracting. (See Davis Co. v. Hoffmann-LaRoche Chemical Works, 178 App.Div. 855, 166 N.Y.S. 179 (1917) and Internation- al Paper Co. v. Rockefeller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146 N.Y.S. 371 (1914).) There is no excuse under this section, how- ever, unless the seller has employed all due measures to assure himself that his source will not fail. (See Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co., Ltd. v. Dunbar Molasses Co., 258 N.Y. 194, 179 N.E. 383, 80 A.L.R. 1173 (1932) and Wash- ington Mfg. Co. v. Midland Lumber Co., 113 Wash. 593, 194 P. 777 (1921).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the case of failure of production by an agreed source for causes beyond the seller&#8217;s control, the seller should, if possible, be excused since production by an agreed source is without more a basic assumption of the contract. Such excuse should not result in relieving the defaulting supplier from liability nor in dropping into the seller&#8217;s lap an unearned bonus of damages over. The flexible adjustment machinery of this Article provides the solution under the provision on the obligation of good faith. A condition to his making good the claim of excuse is the turning over to the buyer of his rights against the defaulting source of supply to the ex- tent of the buyer&#8217;s contract in relation to which excuse is being claimed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. In situations in which neither sense nor justice is served by either answer when the issue is posed in flat terms of &#8220;excuse&#8221; or &#8220;no excuse,&#8221; ad- justment under the various provisions of this Article is necessary, especially the sections on good faith, on insecurity and assurance and on the reading of all provisions in the light of their pur- poses, and the general policy of this Act to use equitable principles in further- ance of commercial standards and good faith.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. The failure of conditions which go to convenience or collateral values rather than to the commercial practicability of the main performance does not amount to a complete excuse. However, good faith and the reason of the present section and of the preced- ing one may properly be held to justify and even to require any needed delay involved in a good faith inquiry seeking a readjustment of the contract terms to meet the new conditions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. The provisions of this sec- tion are made subject to assumption of greater liability by agreement and such agreement is to be found not only in the expressed terms of the contract but in the circumstances surrounding the contracting, in trade usage and the like. Thus the exemptions of this sec- tion do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently foreshad- owed at the time of contracting to be in- cluded among the business risks which are fairly to be regarded as part of the dickered terms, either consciously or as a matter of reasonable, commercial interpretation from the circumstanc- es. (See Madeirense Do Brasil, S.A. v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co., 147 F.2d 399 (C.C.A., 2 Cir., 1945).) The exemp- tion otherwise present through us- age of trade under the present section may also be expressly negated by the language of the agreement. Generally, express agreements as to exemptions designed to enlarge upon or supplant the provisions of this section are to be read in the light of mercantile sense and reason, for this section itself sets <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>up the commercial standard for normal and reasonable interpretation and pro- vides a minimum beyond which agree- ment may not go.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Agreement can also be made in re- gard to the consequences of exemption as laid down in paragraphs (b) and (c) and the next section on procedure on notice claiming excuse.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. The case of a farmer who has contracted to sell crops to be grown on designated land may be regarded as falling either within the section on casualty to identified goods or this section, and he may be excused, when there is a failure of the specific crop, ei- ther on the basis of the destruction of identified goods or because of the fail- ure of a basic assumption of the con- tract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Exemption of the buyer in the case of a &#8220;requirements&#8221; contract is covered by the &#8220;Output and Requirements&#8221; sec- tion both as to assumption and alloca- tion of the relevant risks. But when a contract by a manufacturer to buy fuel or raw material makes no specific reference to a particular venture and no such reference may be drawn from the circumstances, commercial under- standing views it as a general deal in the general market and not conditioned on any assumption of the continuing operation of the buyer&#8217;s plant. Even when notice is given by the buyer that the supplies are needed to fill a specific contract of a normal commercial kind, commercial understanding does not see such a supply contract as conditioned on the continuance of the buyer&#8217;s fur- ther contract for outlet. On the other hand, where the buyer&#8217;s contract is in reasonable commercial understanding conditioned on a definite and specific venture or assumption as, for instance, a war procurement subcontract known to be based on a prime contract which is subject to termination, or a supply contract for a particular construction venture, the reason of the present sec- tion may well apply and entitle the buyer to the exemption.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. Following its basic policy of using commercial practicability as a test for excuse, this section recog- nizes as of equal significance either a foreign or domestic regulation and disregards any technical distinctions between &#8220;law,&#8221; &#8220;regulation,&#8221; &#8220;order&#8221; and the like. Nor does it make the pres- ent action of the seller depend upon the eventual judicial determination of the legality of the particular govern- mental action. The seller&#8217;s good faith belief in the validity of the regulation is the test under this Article and the best evidence of his good faith is the general commercial acceptance of the regulation. However, governmental in- terference cannot excuse unless it truly &#8220;supervenes&#8221; in such a manner as to be beyond the seller&#8217;s assumption of risk. And any action by the party claiming excuse which causes or colludes in in- ducing the governmental action pre- venting his performance would be in breach of good faith and would destroy his exemption.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. An excused seller must fulfill his contract to the extent which the su- pervening contingency permits, and if the situation is such that his custom- ers are generally affected he must take account of all in supplying one. Subsec- tions (a) and (b), therefore, explicitly permit in any proration a fair and rea- sonable attention to the needs of regu- lar customers who are probably relying on spot orders for supplies. Customers at different stages of the manufactur- ing process may be fairly treated by including the seller&#8217;s manufacturing requirements. A fortiori, the seller may also take account of contracts later in date than the one in question. The fact that such spot orders may be closed at an advanced price causes no difficulty, since any allocation which exceeds nor- mal past requirements will not be rea- sonable. However, good faith requires, when prices have advanced, that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>seller exercise real care in making his allocations, and in case of doubt his contract customers should be favored and supplies prorated evenly among them regardless of price. Save for the extra care thus required by changes in the market, this section seeks to leave every reasonable business leeway to the seller.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> No comparable index section. See Section 53, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section is an index section which gathers together in one conve- nient place all of the various remedies open to a seller for any breach by the buyer. This Article rejects any doctrine of election of remedy as a fundamental policy and thus the remedies are essen- tially cumulative in nature and include all of the available remedies for breach. Whether the pursuit of one remedy bars another depends entirely on the facts of the individual case.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The buyer&#8217;s breach which oc- casions the use of the remedies under this section may involve only one lot or delivery of goods, or may involve all of the goods which are the subject matter of the particular contract. The right of the seller to pursue a remedy as to all the goods when the breach is as to only one or more lots is covered by the sec- tion on breach in installment contracts. The present section deals only with the remedies available after the goods in- volved in the breach have been deter- mined by that section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. In addition to the typical case of refusal to pay or default in payment, the language in the preamble, &#8220;fails to make a payment due,&#8221; is intended to cover the dishonor of a check on due presentment, or the non-acceptance of a draft, and the failure to furnish an agreed letter of credit.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. It should also be noted that this Act requires its remedies to be liberally administered and provides that any right or obligation which it declares is enforceable by action un- less a different effect is specifically pre- scribed (Section 1&#8211;106).</p>

<p class="indent1">(a) of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged with- in a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been identified to the contract and are still in his con- trol except that if resale becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. The net proceeds of any such re- sale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(3) Failure of the buyer to effect cover within this section does not bar him from any other remedy.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> None.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. This section provides the buy- er with a remedy aimed at enabling him to obtain the goods he needs thus meeting his essential need. This rem- edy is the buyer&#8217;s equivalent of the seller&#8217;s right to resell.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The definition of &#8220;cover&#8221; un- der subsection (1) envisages a series of contracts or sales, as well as a single contract or sale; goods not identical with those involved but commercially usable as reasonable substitutes un- der the circumstances of the particular case; and contracts on credit or deliv- ery terms differing from the contract in breach, but again reasonable under the circumstances. The test of proper cover is whether at the time and place the buyer acted in good faith and in a reasonable manner, and it is immateri- al that hindsight may later prove that the method of cover used was not the cheapest or most effective.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The requirement that the buyer must cover &#8220;without unreasonable de- lay&#8221; is not intended to limit the time necessary for him to look around and decide as to how he may best effect cover. The test here is similar to that generally used in this Article as to rea- sonable time and seasonable action.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (3) expresses the policy that cover is not a mandatory remedy for the buyer. The buyer is al- ways free to choose between cover and damages for non-delivery under the next section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">However, this subsection must be read in conjunction with the section which limits the recovery of conse- quential damages to such as could not have been obviated by cover. Moreover, the operation of the section on specific performance of contracts for &#8220;unique&#8221; goods must be considered in this con- nection for availability of the goods to the particular buyer for his particular needs is the test for that remedy and inability to cover is made an express condition to the right of the buyer to replevy the goods.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. This section does not limit cov- er to merchants, in the first instance. It is the vital and important remedy for the consumer buyer as well. Both are free to use cover: the domestic or non-merchant consumer is required only to act in normal good faith while the merchant buyer must also observe all reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade, since this falls within the definition of good faith on his part.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Subject to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof of market price (Section 2&#8211;723), the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this Article (Section 2&#8211;715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller&#8217;s breach.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Rewritten.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes: To clarify the former rule so that:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The general baseline adopted in this section uses as a yardstick the market in which the buyer would have obtained cover had he sought that re- lief. So the place for measuring damag- es is the place of tender (or the place of arrival if the goods are rejected or their acceptance is revoked after reaching their destination) and the crucial time is the time at which the buyer learns of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. The market or current price to be used in comparison with the con- tract price under this section is the price for goods of the same kind and in the same branch of trade.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. When the current market price under this section is difficult to prove the section on determination and proof of market price is available to permit a showing of a comparable mar- ket price or, where no market price is available, evidence of spot sale prices is proper. Where the unavailability of a market price is caused by a scarcity of goods of the type involved, a good case is normally made for specific perfor- mance under this Article. Such scarcity conditions, moreover, indicate that the price has risen and under the section providing for liberal administration of remedies, opinion evidence as to the value of the goods would be admissible in the absence of a market price and a liberal construction of allowable conse- quential damages should also result.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. This section carries forward the standard rule that the buyer must deduct from his damages any expenses saved as a result of the breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The present section provides a remedy which is completely alterna- tive to cover under the preceding sec- tion and applies only when and to the extent that the buyer has not covered.</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Subsection (1) is intended to provide reimbursement for the buyer who incurs reasonable expenses in con- nection with the handling of rightfully rejected goods or goods whose accep- tance may be justifiably revoked, or in connection with effecting cover where the breach of the contract lies in non- conformity or non-delivery of the goods. The incidental damages listed are not intended to be exhaustive but are merely illustrative of the typical kinds of incidental damage.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Subsection (2) operates to al- low the buyer, in an appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the seller&#8217;s breach. The &#8220;tacit agreement&#8221; test for the recovery of consequential damages is rejected. Although the older rule at common law which made the seller liable for all con- sequential damages of which he had <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>&#8220;reason to know&#8221; in advance is followed, the liberality of that rule is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not reasonably have pre- vented the loss by cover or otherwise. Subparagraph (2) carries forward the provisions of the prior uniform statu- tory provision as to consequential dam- ages resulting from breach of warranty, but modifies the rule by requiring first that the buyer attempt to minimize his damages in good faith, either by cover or otherwise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. In the absence of excuse un- der the section on merchant&#8217;s excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, the seller is liable for consequential damages in all cases where he had rea- son to know of the buyer&#8217;s general or particular requirements at the time of contracting. It is not necessary that there be a conscious acceptance of an insurer&#8217;s liability on the seller&#8217;s part, nor is his obligation for consequential damages limited to cases in which he fails to use due effort in good faith.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Particular needs of the buyer must generally be made known to the seller while general needs must rarely be made known to charge the seller with knowledge.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Any seller who does not wish to take the risk of consequential damages has available the section on contractual limitation of remedy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. The burden of proving the ex- tent of loss incurred by way of conse- quential damage is on the buyer, but the section on liberal administration of remedies rejects any doctrine of cer- tainty which requires almost math- ematical precision in the proof of loss. Loss may be determined in any man- ner which is reasonable under the cir- cumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Subsection (2)(b) states the usual rule as to breach of warranty, al- lowing recovery for injuries &#8220;proximate- ly&#8221; resulting from the breach. Where the injury involved follows the use of goods without discovery of the defect causing the damage, the question of &#8220;proximate&#8221; cause turns on whether it was reasonable for the buyer to use the goods without such inspection as would have revealed the defects. If it was not reasonable for him to do so, or if he did in fact discover the defect prior to his use, the injury would not proximately result from the breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. In the case of sale of wares to one in the business of reselling them, resale is one of the requirements of which the seller has reason to know within the meaning of subsection (2) (a).</p>

<p class="indent">(2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just.</p>

In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the buyer&#8217;s right of replevin vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provi- sion:</b> Section 68, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Changes:</b> Rephrased.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes of Changes: To make it clear that:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. The present section continues in general prior policy as to specific performance and injunction against breach. However, without intending to impair in any way the exercise of the court&#8217;s sound discretion in the matter, this Article seeks to further a more liberal attitude than some courts have shown in connection with the specific performance of contracts of sale.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. In view of this Article&#8217;s em- phasis on the commercial feasibility of replacement, a new concept of what are &#8220;unique&#8221; goods is introduced under this section. Specific performance is no lon- ger limited to goods which are already specific or ascertained at the time of contracting. The test of uniqueness un- der this section must be made in terms of the total situation which character- izes the contract. Output and require- ments contracts involving a particular or peculiarly available source or mar- ket present today the typical commer- cial specific performance situation, as contrasted with contracts for the sale of heirlooms or priceless works of art which were usually involved in the old- er cases. However, uniqueness is not the sole basis of the remedy under this section for the relief may also be grant- ed &#8220;in other proper circumstances&#8221; and inability to cover is strong evidence of &#8220;other proper circumstances&#8221;.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. The legal remedy of replevin is given to the buyer in cases in which cover is reasonably unavailable and goods have been identified to the con- tract. This is in addition to the buyer&#8217;s right to recover identified goods under Section 2&#8211;502. For consumer goods, the buyer&#8217;s right to replevin vests upon the buyer&#8217;s acquisition of a special proper- ty, which occurs upon identification of the goods to the contract. See Section 2&#8211;501. Inasmuch as a secured party normally acquires no greater rights in its collateral that its debtor had or had power to convey, see Section 2&#8211;403(1) (first sentence), a buyer who acquires a right of replevin under subsection (3) will take free of a security interest cre- ated by the seller if it attaches to the goods after the goods have been identi- fied to the contract. The buyer will take free, even if the buyer does not buy in ordinary course and even if the secu- rity interest is perfected. Of course, to the extent that the buyer pays the price after the security interest attaches, the payments will constitute proceeds of the security interest.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. This section is intended to give the buyer rights to the goods compara- ble to the seller&#8217;s rights to the price.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. If a negotiable document of title is outstanding, the buyer&#8217;s right of replevin relates of course to the docu- ment not directly to the goods. See Ar- ticle 7, especially Section 7&#8211;602.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer&#8217;s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commer- cial is not.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Official Comment</b></p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Under this section parties are left free to shape their remedies to their particular requirements and rea- sonable agreements limiting or modify- ing remedies are to be given effect.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">However, it is of the very essence of a sales contract that at least minimum adequate remedies be available. If the parties intend to conclude a contract for sale within this Article they must accept the legal consequence that there be at least a fair quantum of remedy for breach of the obligations or duties outlined in the contract. Thus any clause purporting to modify or limit the remedial provisions of this Article in an unconscionable manner is subject to deletion and in that event the rem- edies made available by this Article are applicable as if the stricken clause had never existed. Similarly, under subsec- tion (2), where an apparently fair and reasonable clause because of circum- stances fails in its purpose or operates to deprive either party of the substan- tial value of the bargain, it must give way to the general remedy provisions of this Article.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Subsection (1)(b) creates a presumption that clauses prescribing remedies are cumulative rather than exclusive. If the parties intend the term to describe the sole remedy un- der the contract, this must be clearly expressed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. Subsection (3) recognizes the validity of clauses limiting or exclud- ing consequential damages but makes it clear that they may not operate in an unconscionable manner. Actually such terms are merely an allocation of unknown or undeterminable risks. The seller in all cases is free to disclaim warranties in the manner provided in Section 2&#8211;316.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2&#8211;725. Statute of Limitations in Contracts for Sale</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party&#8217;s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of war- ranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a war- ranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsec- tion (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expi- ration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discon- tinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Sales of Accounts, Chattel Paper, Payment Intangibles, Promissory Notes, and Other Re- ceivables.</b> Under subsection (a)(3), as under former Section 9&#8211;102, this Article applies to sales of accounts and chattel paper. This approach generally has been successful in avoiding difficult problems of distinguishing between transactions in which a receivable se- cures an obligation and those in which the receivable has been sold outright. In many commercial financing transac- tions the distinction is blurred.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (a)(3) expands the scope of this Article by including the sale of a &#8220;payment intangible&#8221; (defined in Sec- tion 9&#8211;102 as &#8220;a general intangible under which the account debtor&#8217;s prin- cipal obligation is a monetary obliga- tion&#8221;) and a &#8220;promissory note&#8221; (also defined in Section 9&#8211;102). To a consid- erable extent, this Article affords these transactions treatment identical to that given sales of accounts and chattel paper. In some respects, however, sales of payment intangibles and promissory notes are treated differently from sales of other receivables. See, e.g., Sections 9&#8211;309 (automatic perfection upon at- tachment), 9&#8211;408 (effect of restrictions on assignment). By virtue of the ex- panded definition of &#8220;account&#8221; (defined in Section 9&#8211;102), this Article now covers sales of (and other security inter- ests in) &#8220;health-care-insurance receiv- ables&#8221; (also defined in Section 9&#8211;102). Although this Article occasionally dis- tinguishes between outright sales of receivables and sales that secure an obligation, neither this Article nor the definition of &#8220;security interest&#8221; (Section 1&#8211;201(37)) delineates how a particular transaction is to be classified. That is- sue is left to the courts.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. <b>Transfer of Ownership in Sales of Receivables.</b> A &#8220;sale&#8221; of an account, chattel paper, a promissory note, or a payment intangible includes a sale of a right in the receivable, such as a sale of a participation inter- est. The term also includes the sale of an enforcement right. For example, a &#8220;[p]erson entitled to enforce&#8221; a nego- tiable promissory note (Section 3&#8211;301) may sell its ownership rights in the instrument. See Section 3&#8211;203, Com- ment 1 (&#8220;Ownership rights in instru- ments may be determined by principles of the law of property, independent of Article 3, which do not depend upon whether the instrument was trans- ferred under Section 3&#8211;203.&#8221;). Also, the right under Section 3&#8211;309 to enforce a lost, destroyed, or stolen negotiable promissory note may be sold to a pur- chaser who could enforce that right by causing the seller to provide the proof required under that section. This Ar- ticle rejects decisions reaching a con- trary result, e.g., <i>Dennis Joslin Co. v. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Robinson Broadcasting</i>, 977 F.Supp. 491 (D.D.C.1997).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Nothing in this section or any oth- er provision of Article 9 prevents the transfer of full and complete owner- ship of an account, chattel paper, an instrument, or a payment intangible in a transaction of sale. However, as men- tioned in Comment 4, neither this Arti- cle nor the definition of &#8220;security inter- est&#8221; in Section 1&#8211;201 provides rules for distinguishing sales transactions from those that create a security interest securing an obligation. This Article ap- plies to both types of transactions. The principal effect of this coverage is to apply this Article&#8217;s perfection and pri- ority rules to these sales transactions. Use of terminology such as &#8220;security interest,&#8221; &#8220;debtor,&#8221; and &#8220;collateral&#8221; is merely a drafting convention adopted to reach this end, and its use has no relevance to distinguishing sales from other transactions. See PEB Commen- tary No. 14.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Following a debtor&#8217;s outright sale and transfer of ownership of a receiv- able, the debtor-seller retains no le- gal or equitable rights in the receiv- able that has been sold. See Section 9&#8211;318(a). This is so whether or not the buyer&#8217;s security interest is perfected. (A security interest arising from the sale of a promissory note or payment intangible is perfected upon attach- ment without further action. See Sec- tion 9&#8211;309.) However, if the buyer&#8217;s interest in accounts or chattel paper is unperfected, a subsequent lien credi- tor, perfected secured party, or quali- fied buyer can reach the sold receivable and achieve priority over (or take free of) the buyer&#8217;s unperfected security in- terest under Section 9&#8211;317. This is so not because the seller of a receivable retains rights in the property sold; it does not. Nor is this so because the seller of a receivable is a &#8220;debtor&#8221; and the buyer of a receivable is a &#8220;secured party&#8221; under this Article (they are). It is so for the simple reason that Sec- tions 9&#8211;318(b), 9&#8211;317, and 9&#8211;322 make it so, as did former Sections 9&#8211;301 and 9&#8211;312. Because the buyer&#8217;s security interest is unperfected, for purposes of determining the rights of creditors of and purchasers for value from the debtor-seller, under Section 9&#8211;318(b) the debtor-seller is deemed to have the rights and title it sold. Section 9&#8211;317 subjects the buyer&#8217;s unperfected inter- est in accounts and chattel paper to that of the debtor-seller&#8217;s lien creditor and other persons who qualify under that section.</p>

<p class="comment_indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Rights to Payment.</b> Para- graph (2) expands upon former Section 9&#8211;302(1)(e) by affording automatic per- fection to certain assignments of pay- ment intangibles as well as accounts. The purpose of paragraph (2) is to save from ex post facto invalidation casual or isolated assignments-assignments which no one would think of filing. Any person who regularly takes as- signments of any debtor&#8217;s accounts or payment intangibles should file. In this connection Section 9&#8211;109(d)(4) through (7), which excludes certain transfers of accounts, chattel paper, payment in- tangibles, and promissory notes from this Article, should be consulted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraphs (3) and (4), which are new, afford automatic perfection to sales of payment intangibles and prom- issory notes, respectively. They reflect the practice under former Article 9. Under that Article, filing a financing statement did not affect the rights of a buyer of payment intangibles or prom- issory notes, inasmuch as the former Article did not cover those sales. To the extent that the exception in paragraph (2) covers outright sales of payment intangibles, which automatically are perfected under paragraph (3), the ex- ception is redundant.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (14), which is new, af- fords automatic perfection to sales by individuals of an &#8220;account&#8221; (as defined in Section 9&#8211;102) consisting of the right to winnings in a lottery or other game of chance. Payments on these accounts typically extend for periods of twenty years or more. It would be unduly bur- densome for the secured party, who would have no other reason to main- tain contact with the seller, to moni- tor the seller&#8217;s whereabouts for such a length of time. This paragraph was added in 2001. It applies to a sale of an account described in it, even if the sale was entered into before the effective date of the paragraph. However, if the relative priorities of conflicting claims to the account were established before the paragraph took effect, Article 9 as in effect immediately prior to the date the paragraph took effect determines priority.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. <b>Health-Care-Insurance Receivables.</b> Paragraph (5) extends automatic perfection to assignments of health-care-insurance receivables if the assignment is made to the health- care provider that provided the health- care goods or services. The primary <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>effect is that, when an individual as- signs a right to payment under an in- surance policy to the person who pro- vided health-care goods or services, the provider has no need to file a financ- ing statement against the individual. The normal filing requirements apply to other assignments of health-care- insurance receivables covered by this Article, e.g., assignments from the health-care provider to a financer.</p>

<p class="indent">(b) <b>[Agreement not to assert claim or defense.]</b> Except as oth- erwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment:</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">2. <b>Scope and Purpose.</b> Subsec- tion (b), like former Section 9&#8211;206, gen- erally validates an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor that the account debtor will not assert against an assignee claims and defens- es that it may have against the assign- or. These agreements are typical in in- stallment sale agreements and leases. However, this section expands former Section 9&#8211;206 to apply to all account debtors; it is not limited to account debtors that have bought or leased goods. This section applies only to the obligations of an &#8220;account debtor,&#8221; as defined in Section 9&#8211;102. Thus, it does not determine the circumstances under which and the extent to which a person who is obligated on a negotiable instru- ment is disabled from asserting claims and defenses. Rather, Article 3 must be consulted. See, e.g., Sections 3&#8211;305, 3&#8211;306. Article 3 governs even when the negotiable instrument constitutes part of chattel paper. See Section 9&#8211;102 (an obligor on a negotiable instrument con- stituting part of chattel paper is not an &#8220;account debtor&#8221;).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. <b>Conditions of Validation; Relationship to Article 3.</b> Subsec- tion (b) validates an account debtor&#8217;s agreement only if the assignee takes an assignment for value, in good faith, and without notice of conflicting claims to the property assigned or of certain claims or defenses of the account debt- or. Like former Section 9&#8211;206, this sec- tion is designed to put the assignee in a position that is no better and no worse than that of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under Article 3. However, former Section 9&#8211;206 left open certain issues, e.g., whether the section incorporated the special Article 3 definition of &#8220;value&#8221; in Section 3&#8211;303 or the generally applicable definition in Section 1&#8211;201(44). Subsection (a) ad- dresses this question; it provides that &#8220;value&#8221; has the meaning specified in Section 3&#8211;303(a). Similarly, subsection (c) provides that subsection (b) does not validate an agreement with respect to defenses that could be asserted against a holder in due course under Section 3&#8211;305(b) (the so-called &#8220;real&#8221; defenses). In 1990, the definition of &#8220;holder in due course&#8221; (Section 3&#8211;302) and the articulation of the rights of a holder in due course (Sections 3&#8211;305 and 3&#8211;306) were revised substantially. This sec- tion tracks more closely the rules of Sections 3&#8211;302, 3&#8211;305, and 3&#8211;306.</p>

<p class="indent">(a) <b>[Assignee&#8217;s rights subject to terms, claims, and defenses; exceptions.]</b> Unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agree- ment not to assert defenses or claims, and subject to subsections (b) through (e), the rights of an assignee are subject to:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) all terms of the agreement between the account debtor and as- signor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the trans- action that gave rise to the contract; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives a notifica- tion of the assignment authenticated<b><sup>*</sup></b> by the assignor or the assignee.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) <b>[Account debtor&#8217;s claim reduces amount owed to assignee.]</b> Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection (a) only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) <b>[Rule for individual under other law.]</b> This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation pri- marily for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">2. <b>Purpose; Rights of Assignee in General.</b> Subsection (a), like for- mer Section 9&#8211;318(1), provides that an assignee generally takes an assignment subject to defenses and claims of an ac- count debtor. Under subsection (a)(1), if the account debtor&#8217;s defenses on an assigned claim arise from the transac- tion that gave rise to the contract with the assignor, it makes no difference whether the defense or claim accrues before or after the account debtor is no- tified of the assignment. Under subsec- tion (a)(2), the assignee takes subject to other defenses or claims only if they accrue <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>before the account debtor has been notified of the assignment. Of course, an account debtor may waive its right to assert defenses or claims against an assignee under Section 9&#8211;403 or other applicable law. Subsection (a) tracks Section 3&#8211;305(a)(3) more closely than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="fn_para">* Changed to &#8220;signed&#8221; in 2022 Amendments.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. <b>Limitation on Affirmative Claims.</b> Subsection (b) is new. It limits the claim that the account debtor may assert against an assignee. Borrowing from Section 3&#8211;305(a)(3) and cases con- struing former Section 9&#8211;318, subsec- tion (b) generally does not afford the account debtor the right to an affirma- tive recovery from an assignee.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Consumer Account Debt- ors; Relationship to Federal Trade Commission Rule.</b> Subsections (c) and (d) also are new. Subsection (c) makes clear that the rules of this sec- tion are subject to other law establish- ing special rules for consumer account debtors. An &#8220;account debtor who is an individual&#8221; as used in subsection (c) includes individuals who are jointly or jointly and severally obligated. Subsec- tion (d) applies to rights evidenced by a record that is required to contain, but does not contain, the notice set forth in Federal Trade Commission Rule 433, 16 C.F.R. Part 433 (the &#8220;Holder-in- Due-Course Regulations&#8221;). Under sub- section (d), a consumer account debtor has the same right to an affirmative recovery from an assignee of such a re- cord as the consumer would have had against the assignee had the record contained the required notice.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. <b>Scope; Application to &#8220;Ac- count Debtor.&#8221;</b> This section deals only with the rights and duties of &#8220;ac- count debtors&#8221;-and for the most part only with account debtors on accounts, chattel paper, and payment intangi- bles. Subsection (e) provides that the obligation of an insurer with respect to a health-care-insurance receivable is governed by other law. References in this section to an &#8220;account debtor&#8221; include account debtors on collateral that is proceeds. Neither this section nor any other provision of this Article, including Sections 9&#8211;408 and 9&#8211;409, provides analogous regulation of the rights and duties of other obligors on collateral, such as the maker of a nego- tiable instrument (governed by Article 3), the issuer of or nominated person under a letter of credit (governed by Article 5), or the issuer of a security (governed by Article 8). Article 9 leaves those rights and duties untouched; however, Section 9&#8211;409 deals with the special case of letters of credit. When chattel paper is composed in part of a negotiable instrument, the obligor on the instrument is not an &#8220;account debt- or,&#8221; and Article 3 governs the rights of the assignee of the chattel paper with respect to the issues that this section addresses. See, e.g., Section 3&#8211;601 (dealing with discharge of an obligation to pay a negotiable instrument).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">2. <b>Account Debtor&#8217;s Right to Pay Assignor Until Notification.</b> Subsection (a) provides the general rule concerning an account debtor&#8217;s right to pay the assignor until the ac- count debtor receives appropriate noti- fication. The revision makes clear that once the account debtor receives the notification, the account debtor cannot discharge its obligation by paying the assignor. It also makes explicit that payment to the assignor before notifi- cation, or payment to the assignee after notification, discharges the obligation. No change in meaning from former Section 9&#8211;318 is intended. Nothing in this section conditions the effectiveness of a notification on the identity of the person who gives it. An account debtor that doubts whether the right to pay- ment has been assigned may avail it- self of the procedures in subsection (c). See Comment 4.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>As added in 2022:</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>As to the rights and powers of an as- signee generally, see Section 9</i>&#8211;<i>102(a) (7A) (defining &#8220;assignee), (7B) (defining &#8220;assignor&#8221;), and Comment 2.b.1.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent">An effective notification under sub- section (a) must be authenticated.<b><sup>*</sup></b> This requirement normally could be satisfied by sending notification on the notifying person&#8217;s letterhead or on a form on which the notifying person&#8217;s name appears. In each case the printed name would be a symbol adopted by the notifying person for the purpose of identifying the person and adopting the notification. See Section 9&#8211;102 (de- fining &#8220;authenticate&#8221;).<b><sup>**</sup></b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (a) applies only to ac- count debtors on accounts, chattel paper, and payment intangibles. (Sec- tion 9&#8211;102 defines the term &#8220;account debtor&#8221; more broadly, to include those obligated on all general intangibles.) Although subsection (a) is more pre- cise than its predecessor, it probably does not change the rule that applied under former Article 9. Former Section 9&#8211;318(3) referred to the account debt- or&#8217;s obligation to &#8220;pay,&#8221; indicating that the subsection was limited to account debtors on accounts, chattel paper, and other payment obligations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. <b>Limitations on Effective- ness of Notification.</b> Subsection (b) contains some special rules concerning the effectiveness of a notification under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b)(1) tracks former Sec- tion 9&#8211;318(3) by making ineffective a notification that does not reasonably identify the rights assigned. A reason- able identification need not identify the right to payment with specificity, but what is reasonable also is not left to the arbitrary decision of the account debtor. If an account debtor has doubt as to the adequacy of a notification, it may not be safe in disregarding the no- tification unless it notifies the assignee with reasonable promptness as to the respects in which the account debtor considers the notification defective.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b)(2), which is new, ap- plies only to sales of payment intangi- bles. It makes a notification ineffective to the extent that other law gives effect to an agreement between an account <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>debtor and a seller of a payment intan- gible that limits the account debtor&#8217;s duty to pay a person other than the seller. Payment intangibles are sub- stantially less fungible than accounts and chattel paper. In some (e.g., com- mercial bank loans), account debtors customarily and legitimately expect that they will not be required to pay any person other than the financial in- stitution that has advanced funds.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>*</sup></b> Changed to &#8220;signed&#8221; in 2022 Amendments.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>**</sup></b> Changed to &#8220;see Section 1&#8211;201(b)(37) (defining &#8216;sign&#8217;)&#8221; in 2022 Amendments.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">It has become common in financ- ing transactions to assign interests in a single obligation to more than one assignee. Requiring an account debtor that owes a single obligation to make multiple payments to multiple assign- ees would be unnecessarily burden- some. Thus, under subsection (b)(3), an account debtor that is notified to pay an assignee less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic pay- ment has the option to treat the notifi- cation as ineffective, ignore the notice, and discharge the assigned obligation by paying the assignor. Some account debtors may not realize that the law af- fords them the right to ignore certain notices of assignment with impunity. By making the notification ineffective at the account debtor&#8217;s option, subsec- tion (b)(3) permits an account debtor to pay the assignee in accordance with the notice and thereby to satisfy its obligation pro tanto. Under subsec- tion (g), the rights and duties created by subsection (b)(3) cannot be waived or varied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Proof of Assignment.</b> Sub- section (c) links payment with dis- charge, as in subsection (a). It follows former Section 9&#8211;318(3) in referring to the right of the account debtor to pay the assignor if the requested proof of assignment is not seasonably forth- coming. Even if the proof is not forth- coming, the notification of assignment would remain effective, so that, in the absence of reasonable proof of the as- signment, the account debtor could dis- charge the obligation by paying either the assignee or the assignor. Of course, if the assignee did not in fact receive an assignment, the account debtor cannot discharge its obligation by paying a pu- tative assignee who is a stranger. The observations in Comment 3 concerning the reasonableness of an identification of a right to payment also apply here. An account debtor that questions the adequacy of proof submitted by an as- signor assignee would be well advised to promptly inform the assignor assign- ee of the defects.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">An account debtor may face another problem if its obligation becomes due while the account debtor is awaiting reasonable proof of the assignment that it has requested from the assign- ee. This section does not excuse the ac- count debtor from timely compliance with its obligations. Consequently, an account debtor that has received a no- tification of assignment and who has requested reasonable proof of the as- signment may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor at the time (or even earlier if reasonably necessary to avoid risk of default) when a pay- ment is due, even if the account debtor has not yet received a response to its request for proof. On the other hand, after requesting reasonable proof of the assignment, an account debtor may not discharge its obligation by paying the assignor substantially in advance of the time that the payment is due un- less the assignee has failed to provide the proof seasonably.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. <b>Contractual Restrictions on Assignment.</b> Former Section 9&#8211;318(4) rendered ineffective an agree- ment between an account debtor and an assignor which prohibited assign- ment of an account (whether outright or to secure an obligation) or prohibited a security assignment of a general in- tangible for the payment of money due or to become due. Subsection (d) essen- tially follows former Section 9&#8211;318(4), but expands the rule of free assignabil- ity to chattel paper (subject to Sections <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>2A&#8211;303 and 9&#8211;407) and promissory notes and explicitly overrides both re- strictions and prohibitions of assign- ment. The policies underlying the inef- fectiveness of contractual restrictions under this section build on common- law developments that essentially have eliminated legal restrictions on assignments of rights to payment as se- curity and other assignments of rights to payment such as accounts and chat- tel paper. Any that might linger for ac- counts and chattel paper are addressed by new subsection (f). See Comment 6.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Former Section 9&#8211;318(4) did not ap- ply to a sale of a payment intangible (as described in the former provision, &#8220;a general intangible for money due or to become due&#8221;) but did apply to an as- signment of a payment intangible for security. Subsection (e) continues this approach and also makes subsection (d) inapplicable to sales of promissory notes. Section 9&#8211;408 addresses anti-as- signment clauses with respect to sales of payment intangibles and promissory notes.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Like former Section 9&#8211;318(4), sub- section (d) provides that anti-assign- ment clauses are &#8220;ineffective.&#8221; The quoted term means that the clause is of no effect whatsoever; the clause does not prevent the assignment from taking effect between the parties and the prohibited assignment does not constitute a default under the agree- ment between the account debtor and assignor. However, subsection (d) does not override terms that do not directly prohibit, restrict, or require consent to an assignment but which might, none- theless, present a practical impairment of the assignment. Properly read, how- ever, subsection (d) reaches only cove- nants that prohibit, restrict, or require consents to assignments; it does not override all terms that might &#8220;impair&#8221; an assignment in fact.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Example:</b> Buyer enters into an agreement with Seller to buy equipment that Seller is to manufacture according to Buyer&#8217;s specifications. Buyer agrees to make a series of prepayments dur- ing the construction process. In return, Seller agrees to set aside the prepaid funds in a special account and to use the funds solely for the manufacture of the designated equipment. Seller also agrees that it will not assign any of its rights under the sale agreement with Buyer. Nevertheless, Seller grants to Secured Party a security interest in its accounts. Seller&#8217;s anti-assignment agreement is ineffective under subsec- tion (d); its agreement concerning the use of prepaid funds, which is not a re- striction or prohibition on assignment, is not. However, if Secured Party noti- fies Buyer to make all future payments directly to Secured Party, Buyer will be obliged to do so under subsection (a) if it wishes the payments to discharge its obligation. Unless Secured Party re- leases the funds to Seller so that Seller can comply with its use-of-funds cov- enant, Seller will be in breach of that covenant.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the example, there appears to be a plausible business purpose for the use-of-funds covenant. However, a court may conclude that a covenant with no business purpose other than imposing an impediment to an assign- ment actually is a direct restriction that is rendered ineffective by subsec- tion (d).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. <b>Legal Restrictions on As- signment.</b> Former Section 9&#8211;318(4), like subsection (d) of this section, ad- dressed only contractual restrictions on assignment. The former section was grounded on the reality that legal, as opposed to contractual, restrictions on assignments of rights to payment had largely disappeared. New subsection (f) codifies this principle of free assign- ability for accounts and chattel paper. For the most part the discussion of contractual restrictions in Comment 5 <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>applies as well to legal restrictions ren- dered ineffective under subsection (f).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. <b>Multiple Assignments.</b> This section, like former Section 9&#8211;318, is not a complete codification of the law of assignments of rights to payment. In particular, it is silent concerning many of the ramifications for an account debtor in cases of multiple assignments of the same right. For example, an as- signor might assign the same receiv- able to multiple assignees (which as- signments could be either inadvertent or wrongful). Or, the assignor could as- sign the receivable to assignee-1, which then might re-assign it to assignee-2, and so forth. The rights and duties of an account debtor in the face of mul- tiple assignments and in other circum- stances not resolved in the statutory text are left to the common-law rules. See, e.g., Restatement (2d), Contracts &#167;&#167; 338(3), 339. The failure of former Article 9 to codify these rules does not appear to have caused problems.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. <b>Consumer Account Debt- ors.</b> Subsection (h) is new. It makes clear that the rules of this section are subject to other law establishing spe- cial rules for consumer account debt- ors.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">2. <b>Free Assignability.</b> This sec- tion makes ineffective any attempt to restrict the assignment of a general intangible, health-care-insurance re- ceivable, or promissory note, whether the restriction appears in the terms of a promissory note or the agreement be- tween an account debtor and a debtor (subsection (a)) or in a rule of law, in- cluding a statute or governmental rule or regulation (subsection (c)). This re- sult allows the creation, attachment, and perfection of a security interest in a general intangible, such as an agree- ment for the nonexclusive license of software, as well as sales of certain re- ceivables, such as a health-care-insur- ance receivable (which is an &#8220;account&#8221;), payment intangible, or promissory note, without giving rise to a default or breach by the assignor or from trigger- ing a remedy of the account debtor or person obligated on a promissory note. This enhances the ability of certain debtors to obtain credit. On the other hand, subsection (d) protects the other party-the &#8220;account debtor&#8221; on a gen- eral intangible or the person obligated on a promissory note-from adverse ef- fects arising from the security interest. It leaves the account debtor&#8217;s or obli- gated person&#8217;s rights and obligations unaffected in all material respects if a restriction rendered ineffective by sub- section (a) or (c) would be effective un- der law other than Article 9.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Example 1:</b> A term of an agree- ment for the nonexclusive license of computer software prohibits the licens- ee from assigning any of its rights as licensee with respect to the software. The agreement also provides that an attempt to assign rights in violation of the restriction is a default entitling the licensor to terminate the license agree- ment. The licensee, as debtor, grants to a secured party a security interest in its rights under the license and in the computers in which it is installed. Under this section, the term prohibit- ing assignment and providing for a de- fault upon an attempted assignment is ineffective to prevent the creation, at- tachment, or perfection of the security interest or entitle the licensor to termi- nate the license agreement. However, under subsection (d), the secured party (absent the licensor&#8217;s agreement) is not entitled to enforce the license or to use, assign, or otherwise enjoy the benefits of the licensed software, and the licen- sor need not recognize (or pay any at- tention to) the secured party. Even if <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the secured party takes possession of the computers on the debtor&#8217;s default, the debtor would remain free to remove the software from the computer, load it on another computer, and continue to use it, if the license so permits. If the debtor does not remove the software, other law may require the secured party to remove it before disposing of the computer. Disposition of the soft- ware with the computer could violate an effective prohibition on enforcement of the security interest. See subsection (d).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. <b>Nature of Debtor&#8217;s Inter- est.</b> Neither this section nor any other provision of this Article determines whether a debtor has a property inter- est. The definition of the term &#8220;security interest&#8221; provides that it is an &#8220;inter- est in personal property.&#8221; See Section 1&#8211;201(b)(35). Ordinarily, a debtor can create a security interest in collateral only if it has &#8220;rights in the collateral.&#8221; See Section 9&#8211;203(b). Other law deter- mines whether a debtor has a property interest (&#8220;rights in the collateral&#8221;) and the nature of that interest. For exam- ple, the nonexclusive license addressed in Example 1 may not create any prop- erty interest whatsoever in the intel- lectual property (e.g., copyright) that underlies the license and that effec- tively enables the licensor to grant the license. The debtor&#8217;s property interest may be confined solely to its interest in the promises made by the licensor in the license agreement (e.g., a promise not to sue the debtor for its use of the software).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. <b>Scope: Sales of Payment Intangibles and Other General In- tangibles; Assignments Unaffected by this Section.</b> Subsections (a) and (c) render ineffective restrictions on assignments only &#8220;to the extent&#8221; that the assignments restrict the &#8220;creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest,&#8221; including sales of payment intangibles and promissory notes. This section does not render ineffective a restriction on an assignment that does not create a security interest. For ex- ample, if the debtor in Comment 2, Example 1 purported to assign the li- cense to another entity that would use the computer software itself, other law would govern the effectiveness of the anti-assignment provisions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in payment intangibles only if the security interest arises out of sale of the payment intangibles. Contrac- tual restrictions directed to security interests in payment intangibles which secure an obligation are subject to Sec- tion 9&#8211;406(d). Subsection (a) also deals with sales of promissory notes which also create security interests. See Sec- tion 9&#8211;109(a). Subsection (c) deals with all security interests in payment intan- gibles or promissory notes, whether or not arising out of a sale.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (a) does not render in- effective any term, and subsection (c) does not render ineffective any law, statute or regulation, that restricts outright sales of general intangibles other than payment intangibles. They deal only with restrictions on security interests. The only sales of general in- tangibles that create security interests are sales of payment intangibles.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. <b>Terminology: &#8220;Account Debtor&#8221;; &#8220;Person Obligated on a Promissory Note.&#8221;</b> This section uses the term &#8220;account debtor&#8221; as it is de- fined in Section 9&#8211;102. The term refers to the party, other than the debtor, to a general intangible, including a permit, license, franchise, or the like, and the person obligated on a health- care-insurance receivable, which is a type of account. The definition of &#8220;ac- count debtor&#8221; does not limit the term to persons who are obligated to <i>pay</i> under a general intangible. Rather, the term includes all persons who are obli- gated on a general intangible, includ- ing those who are obligated to render performance in exchange for payment. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>In some cases, e.g., the creation of a se- curity interest in a franchisee&#8217;s rights under a franchise agreement, the prin- cipal payment obligation may be owed <i>by</i> the debtor (franchisee) <i>to</i> the ac- count debtor (franchisor). This section also refers to a &#8220;person obligated on a promissory note,&#8221; inasmuch as those persons do not fall within the definition of &#8220;account debtor.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Example 2:</b> A licensor and licensee enter into an agreement for the nonex- clusive license of computer software. The licensee&#8217;s interest in the license agreement is a general intangible. If the licensee grants to a secured party a security interest in its rights under the license agreement, the licensee is the debtor and the licensor is the ac- count debtor. On the other hand, if the licensor grants to a secured party a se- curity interest in its right to payment (an account) under the license agree- ment, the licensor is the debtor and the licensee is the account debtor. (This section applies to the security interest in the general intangible but not to the security interest in the account, which is not a health-care-insurance receiv- able.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. <b>Effects on Account Debtors and Persons Obligated on Promis- sory Notes.</b> Subsections (a) and (c) affect two classes of persons. These subsections affect account debtors on general intangibles and health-care- insurance receivables and persons obli- gated on promissory notes. Subsection (c) also affects governmental entities that enact or determine rules of law. <i>However, subsection (d) ensures that these affected persons are not affected adversely.</i> That provision removes any burdens or adverse effects on these persons for which any rational basis could exist to restrict the effectiveness of an assignment or to exercise any remedies. For this reason, the effects of subsections (a) and (c) are immaterial insofar as those persons are concerned.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (a) does not override terms that do not directly prohibit, re- strict, or require consent to an assign- ment but which might, nonetheless, present a practical impairment of the assignment. Properly read, however, this section, like Section 9&#8211;406(d), reaches only covenants that prohibit, restrict, or require consents to assign- ments; it does not override all terms that might &#8220;impair&#8221; an assignment in fact.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><b>Example 3:</b> A licensor and licens- ee enter into an agreement for the nonexclusive license of valuable busi- ness software. The license agreement includes terms (i) prohibiting the li- censee from assigning its rights under the license, (ii) prohibiting the licensee from disclosing to anyone certain in- formation relating to the software and the licensor, and (iii) deeming prohib- ited assignments and prohibited dis- closures to be defaults. The licensee wishes to obtain financing and, in ex- change, is willing to grant a security interest in its rights under the license agreement. The secured party, reason- ably, refuses to extend credit unless the licensee discloses the information that it is prohibited from disclosing un- der the license agreement. The secured party cannot determine the value of the proposed collateral in the absence of this information. Under this section, the terms of the license prohibiting the assignment (grant of the security inter- est) and making the assignment a de- fault are ineffective. However, the non- disclosure covenant is not a term that prohibits the assignment or creation of a security interest in the license. Con- sequently, the nondisclosure term is enforceable even though the <i>practical</i> effect is to restrict the licensee&#8217;s abil- ity to use its rights under the license agreement as collateral.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The nondisclosure term also would be effective in the factual setting of Comment 2, Example 1. If the secured party&#8217;s possession of the computers <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>loaded with software would put it in a position to discover confidential infor- mation that the debtor was prohibited from disclosing, the licensor should be entitled to enforce its rights against the secured party. Moreover, the licen- sor could have required the debtor to obtain the secured party&#8217;s agreement that (i) it would immediately return all copies of software loaded on the com- puters and that (ii) it would not exam- ine or otherwise acquire any informa- tion contained in the software. This section does not prevent an account debtor from protecting by agreement its independent interests that are un- related to the &#8220;creation, attachment, or perfection&#8221; of a security interest. In Ex- ample 1, moreover, the secured party is not in possession of copies of software by virtue of its security interest or in connection with enforcing its security interest <i>in the debtor&#8217;s license of the software</i>. Its possession is incidental to its possession of the computers, in which it has a security interest. Enforc- ing against the secured party a restric- tion relating to the software in no way interferes with its security interest in the computers.</p>

<p class="indent1">(2) For purposes of this subdivision, a &#8220;qualified financial con- tract&#8221; means an agreement as to which each party thereto is other than a natural person and that is any of the following:</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) For the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, foreign cur- rency, bullion, coin, or precious metals on a forward, spot, next-day value or other basis.</p>

<p class="indent2">(I) An option with respect to any of the foregoing.</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) There is sufficient evidence that a contract has been made in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) There is evidence of an electronic communication (includ- ing, without limitation, the recording of a telephone call or the tan- gible written text produced by computer retrieval), admissible in evidence under the laws of this state, sufficient to indicate that in the communication a contract was made between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) A confirmation in writing sufficient to indicate that a con- tract has been made between the parties and sufficient against the sender is received by the party against whom enforcement is sought no later than the fifth business day after the contract is made (or any other period of time that the parties may agree in writing) and the sender does not receive, on or before the third business day af- ter receipt (or the other period of time that the parties may agree in writing), written objection to a material term of the confirmation. For purposes of this subparagraph, a confirmation or an objection thereto is received at the time there has been an actual receipt by an individual responsible for the transaction or, if earlier, at the time there has been constructive receipt, which is the time actual receipt by that individual would have occurred if the receiving par- ty, as an organization, had exercised reasonable diligence.

<p class="indent2">(D) There is a note, memorandum, or other writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by its authorized agent or broker.</p>
<p class="noindent">For purposes of this paragraph, evidence of an electronic communica- tion indicating the making in that communication of a contract, or a confirmation, admission, note, memorandum, or writing is not insuffi- cient because it omits or incorrectly states one or more material terms agreed upon, as long as the evidence provides a reasonable basis for concluding that a contract was made.</p>

The confirmation and notice of objection referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) may be communicated by means of telex, telefacsimile, computer, or other similar process by which electronic signals are transmitted by telephone or otherwise, provided that a party claiming to have communicated in that manner shall, unless the parties have otherwise agreed in writing, have the burden of establishing actual or constructive receipt by the other party as set forth in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="indent">(c) This section does not apply to leases subject to Division 10 (com- mencing with Section 10101) of the Commercial Code.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) An electronic message of an ephemeral nature that is not designed to be retained or to create a permanent record, including, but not limited to, a text message or instant message format communication, is insuf- ficient under this title to constitute a contract to convey real property, in the absence of a written confirmation that conforms to the requirements of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b).</p>

<p class="indent1">1. An agreement, promise, undertaking or contract, which is val- id in other respects and is otherwise enforceable, is not void for lack of a note, memorandum or other writing and is enforceable by way of action or defense provided that such agreement, promise, undertaking or contract is a qualified financial contract as defined in paragraph two of this subdivision and (a) there is, as provided in paragraph three of this subdivision, sufficient evidence to indicate that a contract has been made, or (b) the parties thereto, by means of a prior or subse- quent written contract, have agreed to be bound by the terms of such qualified financial contract from the time they reach agreement (by telephone, by exchange of electronic messages, or otherwise) on those terms.</p>
<p class="indent1">2. For purposes of this subdivision, a &#8220;qualified financial con- tract&#8221; means an agreement as to which each party thereto is other than a natural person and which is:</p>
<p class="indent2">(a) for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, foreign cur- rency, bullion, coin or precious metals on a forward, spot, next-day value or other basis;</p>
<p class="indent2">(b) a contract (other than a contract for the purchase and sale of a commodity for future delivery on, or subject to the rules of, a contract market or board of trade) for the purchase, sale or trans- fer of any commodity or any similar good, article, service, right, or interest which is presently or in the future becomes the subject of dealing in the forward contract trade, or any product or byproduct thereof, with a maturity date more than two days after the date the contract is entered into;</p>
<p class="indent2">(c) for the purchase and sale of currency, or interbank deposits denominated in United States dollars;</p>
<p class="indent2">(d) for a currency option, currency swap or cross-currency rate swap;</p>
<p class="indent2">(e) for a commodity swap or a commodity option (other than an option contract traded on, or subject to the rules of a contract market or board of trade);</p>
<p class="indent2">(f) for a rate swap, basis swap, forward rate transaction, or an interest rate option;</p>
<p class="indent2">(g) for a security-index swap or option or a security (or securi- ties) price swap or option;</p>
<p class="indent2">(h) an agreement which involves any other similar transac- tion relating to a price or index (including, without limitation, any transaction or agreement involving any combination of the forego- ing, any cap, floor, collar or similar transaction with respect to a <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rate, commodity price, commodity index, security (or securities) price, security-index or other price index);</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) for the assignment, sale, trade, participation or exchange of indebtedness or claims relating thereto arising in the course of the claimant&#8217;s business or profession (including but not limited to commercial and/or bank loans, choses in action arising under or in connection with loan agreements and private notes, and includ- ing forward sales), but only to the extent that such indebtedness or obligation was not incurred by a natural person primarily for personal, family or household purposes; or</p>
<p class="indent2">(j) an option with respect to any of the foregoing.</p>
<p class="indent1">3. There is sufficient evidence that a contract has been made if:</p>
<p class="indent2">(a) There is evidence of electronic communication (including, without limitation, the recording of a telephone call or the tangible written text produced by computer retrieval), admissible in evi- dence under the laws of this state, sufficient to indicate that in such communication a contract was made between the parties;</p>
<p class="indent2">(b) A confirmation in writing sufficient to indicate that a con- tract has been made between the parties and sufficient against the sender is received by the party against whom enforcement is sought no later than the fifth business day after such contract is made (or such other period of time as the parties may agree in writing) and the sender does not receive, on or before the third business day after such receipt (or such other period of time as the parties may agree in writing), written objection to a material term of the confir- mation; for purposes of this subparagraph, a confirmation or an ob- jection thereto is received at the time there has been actual receipt by an individual responsible for the transaction or, if earlier, at the time there has been constructive receipt which is the time actual receipt by such an individual would have occurred if the receiving party, as an organization, has exercised reasonable diligence; and a &#8220;business day&#8221; for the purposes of this subparagraph is a day on which both parties are open and transacting business of the kind involved in that qualified financial contract which is the subject of the confirmation;</p>
<p class="indent2">(c) The party against whom enforcement is sought admits in its pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract was made; or</p>
<p class="indent2">(d) There is a note, memorandum or other writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by its authorized agent or broker.</p>
<p class="noindent">For purposes of this paragraph evidence of an electronic communication indicating the making therein of a contract or a confirmation, admission, note, memorandum or writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>states one or more material terms agreed upon, so long as such evidence provides a reasonable basis for concluding that a contract was made.</p>
<p class="indent1">4. For purposes of this subdivision, the tangible written text pro- duced by telex, telefacsimile, computer retrieval or other process by which electronic signals are transmitted by telephone or otherwise shall constitute a writing and any symbol executed or adopted by a party with the present intention to authenticate a writing shall consti- tute a signing. The confirmation and notice of objection referred to in subparagraph (b) of paragraph three of this subdivision may be com- municated by means of telex, telefacsimile, computer or other similar process by which electronic signals are transmitted by telephone or otherwise, provided that a party claiming to have communicated in such a manner shall, unless the parties have otherwise agreed in writ- ing, have the burden of establishing actual or constructive receipt by the other party as set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph three of this subdivision.</p>

<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 1.01 Definitions</b></p>
<p class="indent">As used in these Principles</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">(k) Standard Form and Standard Term</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) A &#8220;standard form&#8221; is a record regularly used to embody terms of agreements of the same type.</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) A &#8220;standard term&#8221; is a term appearing in a standard form and relating to a particular matter.</p>
<p class="indent">(l) Standard-Form Transfer of Generally Available Software</p>
<p class="indent">A &#8220;standard-form transfer of generally available software&#8221; is a trans- fer using a standard form of</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) a small number of copies of software to an end user; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the right to access software to a small number of end users</p>
<p class="indent">if the software is generally available to the public under substantially the same standard terms.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Generally.</i> Standard-form transfers of generally available soft- ware target retail-like transactions. Transfers of a small number of cop- ies of software are consistent with the quantity of software transferred in a typical retail sale. However, the definition includes some transfers not usually considered retail transactions, such as some transfers of open-source software, shareware, and freeware.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">An end user under this definition intends to use the software for busi- ness, personal, or family reasons, and includes large and small businesses and consumers. But end users under this definition do not intend to offer the software commercially to third parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 2.02, Comment a, discusses the reasons for including businesses in the treatment of small-quantity standard-form transfers. Section 2.01, on formation, governs standard-form transfers if the quantity of copies transferred is not small. Section 2.01 also applies if the software is not gen- erally available to the public under the same standard terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Software is not generally avail- able to the public if it is customized more than insignificantly. Similarly, software is not available to the public under substantially the same standard terms if the terms differ from those of- fered in the general market more than insignificantly due to negotiation or otherwise. Software is &#8220;generally avail- able to the public&#8221; even if certain sub- sets of the public are excluded from obtaining it, such as people under 18 years of age. Further, software is &#8220;gen- erally available to the public&#8221; even if software marketing targets particu- lar groups, such as foreign speakers or particular services or industries, so long as the software is available to the general public.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>CHAPTER 2. FORMATION AND ENFORCEMENT</b></p>
<p class="head3"><b>TOPIC 1. FORMATION, GENERALLY</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2.01 Formation, Generally</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) Subject to &#167; 2.02, a contract may be formed in any manner suf- ficient to show an agreement, including by offer and acceptance and by conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A contract may be formed under subsection (a) even though</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) one or more terms are left open, if there is a reasonably certain basis for granting an appropriate remedy in the event of a breach; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the parties&#8217; records are different. In such a case, the terms of the contract are</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) terms, whether in a record or not, to which both parties agree;</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) terms that appear in the records of both parties; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(C) terms supplied by these Principles or other law.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230; <i>b. General rule.</i> &#8230; Provid- ers of custom software or those trans- ferring a large number of copies of software sometimes present standard forms to the transferee on a take-it- or-leave-it basis. A transferor may present the standard form in a man- ner called &#8220;shrinkwrap&#8221; because the terms appear on or inside the software package after the transferee has paid for the software. Or a transferor may present terms electronically as part of a &#8220;browsewrap&#8221; transaction, in which the transferee views a screen that re- fers to terms that can be found else- where before downloading the software electronically. The act of downloading or some other act is considered accep- tance of the terms. Finally, transferors may employ a &#8220;clickwrap&#8221; presentation, in which the end user, who downloads software electronically, must click &#8220;I agree&#8221; to terms presented electronical- ly in order to complete the transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 2.01 governs the enforce- ment of contracts formed in any of these manners if the transfer is of a large number of copies of the software or the software is not generally avail- able under the same standard terms. Transferees in such transactions may <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>consist of sophisticated businesses that should be expected to insist on access to the standard form, to read and un- derstand the form, and even, in some instances, to bargain successfully for better terms. Even if a transferee busi- ness is small and less sophisticated, large-quantity or custom-software transactions should constitute a red flag that the standard form is impor- tant and should be read. The Principles therefore take the position that such transferees do not need the special safeguards of &#167; 2.02. See &#167; 2.02, Com- ment a. Further, &#167; 2.01 does not rule out enforcement of any of the standard- form presentations so long as the cir- cumstances show that both parties in- tended to form an agreement and the transferee had reasonable notice of the terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Nevertheless, courts applying &#167; 2.01 to any standard-form transaction should be especially vigilant about the formation process on the theory that even in large-quantity, standard-form transactions or custom-software trans- actions transferees may have little or no bargaining power or choice. In fact, some evidence suggests that within particular software markets standard- form transferors can dictate terms and adopt dubious, retail-like strategies even when the transferee is a business and the number of copies of software is large or the software is custom engi- neered. It is also clear that transferors include in their forms very stringent limitations of liability and broad reser- vations of ownership rights in the soft- ware in retail and other business mar- kets alike. Software transferors may have ample reasons for including such terms, but in some circumstances their existence tends to show that transfer- ors have superior bargaining power at the expense of businesses acquiring custom software or large quantities of software.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">There are several possible explana- tions for transferor bargaining power in this context. An obvious reason is that some transferors have few competitors. The market may be highly concen- trated. In addition, liability limitations may be extremely important because of the uncertain, but potentially large damages that can result from defective software. Retaining property rights in the software and restrictions on use also may be crucial because of the ease of copying and transferring software. The importance of such boilerplate may signal to transferees the unwillingness of transferors to make concessions. Fur- ther, if the subject matter is standard software that the transferee downloads from the Internet, the transferee likely will neither seek nor be able to extract concessions from the transferor despite a large-quantity transaction. These considerations do not mean that stan- dard forms should be unenforceable in this setting, only that courts should not exempt them from scrutiny simply be- cause the transfer is large or of custom software. Even such business transfer- ees may have little or no bargaining power and therefore may fail to read the standard form.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In applying the objective test of as- sent of subsection (a), courts should therefore consider factors not unlike those set forth in &#167; 2.02(c), infra, in- cluding whether the transferee re- ceived adequate notice of and access to the standard form before and at the time of the transfer, the likelihood that the transferee will read the standard form, and its comprehensibility. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Different records.</i> Subsec- tion (b)(2) follows U.C.C. &#167; 2&#8211;207 and amended U.C.C. &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;206 and 2&#8211;207 in rejecting the common-law mirror- image rule, which barred formation of a contract if an acceptance was not identical to the offer. If under &#167; 2.01(a) the circumstances show that the par- ties intended to contract, a contract can be formed even though the parties&#8217; records are different. For example, the parties can form a contract in the &#8220;battle-of-the-forms&#8221; <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>context if their sub- sequent performance shows that they made an agreement and intended to ignore the contradictory terms in their communications.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">U.C.C. &#167; 2&#8211;207(1) and (2) cause confusion because subsection (1) re- fers to &#8220;additional or different terms,&#8221; but subsection (2) refers only to &#8220;addi- tional&#8221; terms. Further, &#167; 2&#8211;207 defines neither &#8220;additional&#8221; nor &#8220;different.&#8221; Section 2.01(b)(2) of these Principles applies if the parties&#8217; records do not es- tablish a contract because the records are &#8220;different,&#8221; here meaning that the terms are not the same in each record. Records are &#8220;different&#8221; therefore if one record contains a term that does not appear in the other record or one record changes a term in the other record.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In cases of contracts formed under subsections (a) and (b)(2), &#167; 2.01(b)(2)(A) through (C) determine the terms. These subsections follow the approach of amended &#167; 2&#8211;207 because it is clear- er and simpler than original &#167; 2&#8211;207 and is party neutral. (Original &#167; 2&#8211;207 favored the party who sent an offer be- cause material changes in the accep- tance would not become part of the con- tract. If neither party read the other&#8217;s form, but goods were delivered and ac- cepted, there seems to be little reason to favor either party.) Under &#167; 2.01(b)(2) of these Principles, the terms con- sist of terms common to both records, other terms the parties agreed to, and supplemental terms supplied by these Principles and outside law. Thus, if the parties&#8217; records differ insubstantially, courts can enforce the common terms under &#167; 2.01(b)(2)(B).</p>

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 2.02 Standard-Form Transfers Of Generally Available Software; Enforcement Of The Standard Form</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) This Section applies to standard-form transfers of generally avail- able software as defined in &#167; 1.01(l).</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A transferee adopts a standard form as a contract when a reason- able transferor would believe the transferee intends to be bound to the form.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) A transferee will be deemed to have adopted a standard form as a contract if</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) the standard form is reasonably accessible electronically prior to initiation of the transfer at issue;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) upon initiating the transfer, the transferee has reasonable no- tice of and access to the standard form before payment or, if there is no payment, before completion of the transfer;</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) in the case of an electronic transfer of software, the transferee signifies agreement at the end of or adjacent to the electronic standard <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>form, or in the case of a standard form printed on or attached to pack- aged software or separately wrapped from the software, the transferee does not exercise the opportunity to return the software unopened for a full refund within a reasonable time after the transfer; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) the transferee can store and reproduce the standard form if presented electronically.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Subject to &#167; 1.10 (public policy), &#167; 1.11 (unconscionability), and other invalidating defenses supplied by these Principles or outside law, a standard term is enforceable if reasonably comprehensible.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) If a transferee asserts that it did not adopt a standard form as a contract under subsection (b) or asserts a failure of the transferor to com- ply with subsection (c) or (d), the transferor has the burden of production and persuasion on the issue of compliance with the subsections.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Section 2.02 applies to standard-form transfers of generally available software (defined in &#167; 1.01(l)) only. These include electronic and pre- packaged software transfers.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 2.02(b) adopts the general contract-law objective test of contract formation. See Comment b. Subsection (c) enumerates factors that ensure en- forcement of a standard form under the objective test of formation. Subsection (d) requires clarity of standard terms, and subsection (e) deals with burdens of proof.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 2.02 applies whether the transferee is a consumer or a large-or small-business end user, so long as the software is available to the general pub- lic under substantially the same terms and the quantity of copies transferred is small, meaning consistent with a retail sale. See &#167; 1.01(l), Comment a. Restricting the reach of this Section to consumers would create hardship for many small businesses, who essen- tially are in the same position as con- sumers downloading software over the Internet. Even large businesses (who less regularly shop for software in a re- tail market) may have difficulty over- seeing their employees&#8217; processing of small-quantity software transactions, especially if there is no opportunity to peruse the terms prior to a transaction. Further, drawing lines between what constitutes a large or small business or between businesses in the same posi- tion as consumers and businesses with a better bargaining position would be difficult and largely arbitrary. In addi- tion, enlarging the scope of the Section to include businesses should increase the incentive of drafters to write rea- sonable terms because businesses are more likely to read disclosed terms. Perhaps most important, because the elements of &#167; 2.02 are largely in the nature of disclosure and not onerous for transferors, a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; ap- proach is sure to reach all of those wor- thy of disclosure protection without un- duly burdening software transferors.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Transferees that acquire a large number of copies of software or gain the right to access software for a large number of users pursuant to a stan- dard form do not come under &#167; 2.02. Nor do transferees of custom software even if the quantity is small. Such transferees do not necessarily need the special considerations of this Section because they often consist of sophisti- cated businesses that should be expect- ed to insist on access to and to read and understand the standard form, and even in some instances, to bargain suc- cessfully for better terms. Even if the transferee&#8217;s business is small and less <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>sophisticated, large-quantity and often expensive custom-software transac- tions should constitute a red flag that the standard form is important and should be read. Nonetheless, as devel- oped more fully in Comment b to &#167; 2.01, courts applying that Section should be especially vigilant about the formation process and the substantive terms on the theory that even in large-quantity, standard-form transactions or custom- software transactions transferees may have little or no bargaining power and the standard form may contain suspect terms. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. General rule.</i> Section 2.02(b) adopts the flexible contract-law ap- proach to contract formation that bases formation on the objective test of whether a reasonable transferor would believe the transferee intends to be bound. Notwithstanding this approach, in many instances, failure to satisfy subsection (c), which consists of trans- feror best practices, may mean that the standard form will not be enforceable because a reasonable transferor would not believe the transferee intends to be bound to the form. In such cases, if the transfer has not been terminated, the terms of the contract consist of those terms in which the parties agree, the terms supplied by these Principles, and outside-law default rules. Cf. &#167; 2.01(b) (2).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b) also applies subject to other Sections of these Principles, such as &#167; 1.11 (unconscionability), and outside law also may bar the formation of a contract or enforcement of some of its terms. Nor does subsection (b) preempt consumer-protection law. See &#167; 1.12.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><u>Electronic transfers of software</u> Section 2.02(b) is consistent with the general emerging approach to e- standard forms that allows for various kinds of acceptable electronic presen- tations of the standard form. For ex- ample, under current technology, if a transferee clicks on an &#8220;I agree&#8221; icon located at the end of a standard form, a reasonable transferor would believe the transferee intends to adopt the standard form as a contract. The same result may follow even if the terms are accessible via a hyperlink or a scroll- down window located near the &#8220;I agree&#8221; icon provided that the transferee must click &#8220;I agree&#8221; or the like. Other presen- tations may be more problematic. For example, mere reference to standard terms found on another page (browse- wrap) may be insufficient under the reasonable-transferor test unless the transferee is already well-acquainted with the terms, for example, from pre- vious notices and transactions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">For several reasons, &#167; 2.02(b) does not establish a bright-line rule for enforcement requiring, for example, clicking &#8220;I agree&#8221; at the end of an elec- tronic standard form. First, as already mentioned, case law already presents a wide variety of formation types that are not easily captured by a narrow rule and, for the most part, handle the issues in an effective manner. These include situations in which the trans- feree is aware of the terms because of a course of dealing or because the trans- feror delivered an update of previously downloaded software. The safeguard of requiring a click at the end of the form does not seem necessary in either case. Second, open-source transfers rarely follow the current click-wrap model, and these Principles should not upset an established custom unless problematic. Third, certain publishers of software, such as shareware, may have difficulty ensuring that Internet distributors of their software abide by bright-line formation requirements. Fourth, some transactions simply may be too cumbersome yet sufficiently in- significant to require scrolling through a standard form before agreeing to the form. Nevertheless, in the usual case, transferors should adopt the best practices of subsection (c) to ensure enforcement <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the form, which include presenting the standard form in a man- ner that requires clicking &#8220;I agree&#8221; or the like at the end of or adjacent to the standard form. See Comment c.</p>

If B was unaware of the terms because of the lack of previous dealings with A or otherwise, a court may find that a reasonable transferor would not be- lieve B intended to be bound to the terms.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><u>Packaged Software</u></p>
<p class="comment_indent">In a typical transfer of packaged software, often called a &#8220;shrinkwrap transaction,&#8221; the transferee acquires the packaged software either at a store or by placing an order on an Internet site or over the telephone and pays with a credit card. The first opportuni- ty to read the terms, usually contained in the package or presented electroni- cally upon downloading and installing the software, occurs after the transfer- ee brings the software package home or the software is delivered. Shrinkwrap agreements obviously exacerbate the problem of standard forms by requir- ing payment before the transferee sees the terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Courts first considering the shrink- wrap process (many of the cases, both old and recent, involve hard goods such as computers) did not favor shrinkwrap terms because of their unavailability until after payment. Commentators criticized UCITA for taking a con- trary position. Under UCITA &#167; 112(a), shrinkwrap terms are enforceable if a person &#8220;manifests assent&#8221; after an &#8220;op- portunity to review&#8221; the terms. Under &#167; 113(a), &#8220;[a] person has an opportunity to review&#8221; a term if it is &#8220;made avail- able in a manner that ought to call it to the attention of a reasonable person and permit review.&#8221; Under &#167; 113(c), in shrinkwrap situations, with some exceptions, a &#8220;person has an opportu- nity to review only if it has a right to a return if it rejects the record.&#8221; Writers thought that copyholders who brought their software home might delay open- ing the package or returning the soft- ware, or might decide not to return it because of their needs, the cost of re- turning it, or their unhappiness with only a few terms. In any of these situ- ations, a copyholder probably would be bound to the terms under UCITA&#8217;s test. Despite these criticisms of shrinkwrap presentations, many courts and com- mentators note the value and popular- ity of the shrinkwrap method of doing business.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b) allows for various methods of packaged-software contract formation, based on when a reasonable transferor would believe the transferee intends to be bound. For example, if a printed standard form is not separately wrapped from the software, a transfer- ee may adopt the standard form as a contract by failing to exercise the op- portunity to return the software opened or unopened for a full refund within a reasonable time after the transfer. If the transferee can read the standard form before opening the software be- cause, for example, the standard form is printed on or attached to the package or the standard form and the software are separately wrapped within the package, a reasonable transferor may believe that the transferee intends to be bound upon opening the software wrapper.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Methods of notice and presenta- tion of a printed standard form that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>fall between these examples require a case-by-case judicial analysis of what is reasonable under the circumstances. Notwithstanding the open-endedness of subsection (b), subsection (c) pre- scribes best practices that ensure en- forcement of the standard form.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">&#8230; 4. B, a consumer, acquires a copy of a word-processing program at a retail store. A is the manufac- turer of the software. The software package contains a paper copy of the standard form attached to the package that is accessible without opening the software. A court may find that a reasonable transferor would believe that B intends to be bound to the standard form if B opens the software wrapper. A can ensure enforcement by following the requirements of subsection (c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Best practices.</i> Subsection (c) prescribes best practices and consti- tutes a safe-harbor provision for trans- ferors. Compliance with subsection (c) should assure a transferor of the en- forcement of the standard form, but failure to comply does not absolutely bar a transferor from otherwise prov- ing transferee assent. Unsophisticated transferors who may not have knowl- edge of the requirements of subsection (c) or cannot prove whether or what type of standard form was posted at the time of contracting should not be precluded from establishing the trans- feree&#8217;s intention to be bound based on subsection (b). See also Comment b. Further, when appropriate, an ob- jective of the Principles is to present courts with perspectives on best prac- tices, not to prescribe flat rules. Not- withstanding the nature of subsection (c), in many instances, failure to com- ply with the subsection should mean that the standard form will not be en- forceable because it fails the reason- able-transferor test of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (c) presents several re- quirements. The standard form must be reasonably accessible electronically prior to any particular transaction (re- gardless of whether the standard form is electronic or printed); upon initiation of a transaction, the transferee must receive reasonable notice of and access to the standard form prior to payment or completion of the transaction; the transferee must signify agreement at the end of or adjacent to an e-standard form or, in the case of a standard form printed on or attached to a package or separately wrapped from the software, must fail to exercise the opportunity to return the packaged software un- opened for a full refund within a rea- sonable time; the terms must be rea- sonably comprehensible; and electronic terms must be capable of storage and reproduction, such as by printing a hard copy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under subsection (c)(1), a standard form must be reasonably accessible electronically prior to initiation of the transaction at issue. Initiation of a transfer occurs when, viewed objective- ly, the transferee intends to contract and begins that process, such as by clicking on a &#8220;purchase&#8221; icon that pre- cedes elicitation of payment informa- tion or by bringing packaged software to the check-out line in a retail store. Based on current technology, a trans- feror therefore can satisfy this aspect of subsection (c)(1) by maintaining an Internet presence and by posting its terms prior to the initiation of any par- ticular transfer so that transferees can read and compare terms without en- tering a transaction at all. Accessibil- ity issues under subsection (c)(1) also include the sufficiency of notice on the website of the standard form&#8217;s avail- ability, who must display the standard form, the manner of presentation, and when the standard form is available to read.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">For example, notice on the transfer- or&#8217;s homepage of the availability of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>standard form should be sufficient if a visitor to the site could not help but see the notice. Based on current technol- ogy, the standard form should be rea- sonably accessible from the website of the party asserting enforcement of the standard form against the transferee. This will usually be the software man- ufacturer or access provider, but it also may be a retail vendor with a web pres- ence. It is hard to imagine that a soft- ware manufacturer would not already have a presence on the Internet but, at any rate, creating and maintaining a homepage should not be costly. Nor should disclosure of terms on the web- site be expensive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Based on current technology, rea- sonable accessibility with respect to the manner of presentation means, for example, that the standard form should not disappear after appear- ing on a computer screen and should be conspicuously displayed. In addi- tion, standard terms should be on the homepage or only a few clicks away because transferees may become dis- couraged and lose interest if they must search too far to reach their Internet destination.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Reasonable accessibility with re- spect to time means that the standard form is on display for a reasonable time prior to initiation of a transaction. A &#8220;reasonable time&#8221; depends on the cir- cumstances, but would ordinarily mean that the terms are available during the period a typical shopper would look for them prior to a transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (c)(2)&#8217;s notice and access requirements are different from the re- quirements of (c)(1). Subsection (c)(1) requires a transferor to maintain a web presence and to post its terms prior to any particular transaction. A transfer- ee could then see terms without enter- ing any transaction at all. Subsection (c)(2), on the other hand, applies to a transaction in progress and requires a presentation so that the transferee cannot help but become aware of the terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In an electronic transfer of soft- ware, for example, subsection (c)(2)&#8217;s notice and access requirements require first that the notice is conspicuous both in terms of placement and size so that a transferee cannot help but see the notice. Further, the notice should con- stitute a hyperlink that leads directly to the standard form or, at minimum, the standard form should be only a few clicks away from the notice. The stan- dard form itself also must be conspicu- ously displayed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the case of packaged software ordered by telephone, subsection (c)(2) would be satisfied by an announce- ment of the form&#8217;s availability on the Internet. Although a transferee is un- likely to terminate the telephone call to access and read the standard form, a transferee should be made aware of that opportunity before payment. As mentioned in the Summary Overview to Topic 2, &#8220;[i]ncreasing the opportu- nity to read supports autonomy rea- sons for enforcing software standard forms. &#8230;&#8221; If the transferee is physi- cally present in a store, the store can satisfy the requirements of subsection (c)(2) by posting or distributing the standard form or by making a comput- er available to view the terms online. Reasonable accessibility also requires the store to furnish adequate notice of the availability of the terms. Adequate notice requires that a reasonable shop- per would understand that the terms are available on paper or by using a store computer prior to a transaction. Standard forms printed on or attached to the software package ordinarily are reasonably accessible as well. In the case of orders placed over the Internet for packaged software, the provider can present the terms electronically.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under subsection (c)(3), to signify acceptance and to complete an elec- tronic transfer of software, a transferee <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>must click &#8220;I agree&#8221; or the like after terms are presented on a screen, just as a transferee must sign a paper stan- dard form. Subsection (c)(3) would be satisfied, for example, if the &#8220;I agree&#8221; icon is adjacent to a scroll-down win- dow that contains the standard form. This form of clickwrap closely resem- bles traditional modes of agreeing to paper standard forms. Under subsec- tion (c)(3), a mere screen reference to terms that can be found somewhere else on the site would be insufficient as would a scroll-down window containing the standard form if the &#8220;I agree&#8221; icon is not at the end of or adjacent to the standard form.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the case of packaged software, under current marketing processes, at least in theory, a transferee in a shrinkwrap transaction can return software for a full refund after opening the software package and reviewing the terms. However, in reality many, perhaps most, retailers refuse to ac- cept returns of software if the package is opened, presumably at least in part because transferees can easily make a copy of the software before returning it. Further, monitoring and policing the transferee to deter copying is problem- atic. In addition, some retailers have begun charging a &#8220;restocking fee&#8221; for returns.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">To satisfy subsection (c)(3), the standard form must be accessible with- out opening the software package. In fact, under &#167; 2.02(c), a transferee has several opportunities to read the stan- dard form before opening the software package. Therefore, a transferee can return packaged software and receive a refund for a reasonable time, but only if the package is unopened. Under this approach, the transferor does not have to monitor or police transferee copying before returning the software. Further, the subsection should create incentives for transferors to make their standard forms separately accessible. Section 2.02(b) governs the question of a trans- feree&#8217;s adoption of a standard form if the transferee opens a software pack- age in which the standard form is not separately accessible on or in the pack- age.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><u>Sales of Computers with Pre-loaded Software</u></p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under current conditions, a pur- chaser of a computer with pre-loaded software usually cannot use the soft- ware until the purchaser clicks on an &#8220;I agree&#8221; icon after turning on the com- puter for the first time and accessing the software. Subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) apply to this mode of transfer, so that if the software transferor does not make the terms available before the computer-buyer decides to purchase the computer and again upon initiating the purchase, whether by telephone, Internet, or in a store, the transaction would not come within the best practic- es of (c)(1) and (c)(2) (and enforcement of the software terms would depend on subsection (b)). However, subsection (c)(3) should not apply in the case of software loaded on a new computer. In such a case, (c)(3) would raise intrac- table questions regarding the trans- feree&#8217;s right to return the computer because of dissatisfaction with the soft- ware terms and regarding the alloca- tion of expenses for doing so. Further, so long as the transferor satisfies sub- sections (c)(1) and (c)(2), the computer purchaser has ample opportunity to see the software terms. A purchaser of a new car likely cannot rescind the deal because of dissatisfaction with the warranty terms for the tires. Further, if the purchaser had reasonable access to the tire warranties before the pur- chase, the purchaser probably should be bound to the terms. These Principles take the position that a software trans- feree who purchases a new computer with pre-loaded software should be treated no differently.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under current technology, subsec- tion (c)(4) is satisfied if the transferee <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>can print a hard copy of the electronic terms and save them on the transfer- ee&#8217;s hard drive.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">7. B, a merchant in business for herself, downloads from A, a software manufacturer, a single copy of a software &#8220;plug-in&#8221; that serves to enhance the user&#8217;s brows- er capabilities. The standard-form licensing agreement is available on A&#8217;s homepage prior to the transac- tion. However, the license appears in a scroll-down window for two minutes and then disappears. Fur- ther, the standard form occupies such a small part of the screen that the form is not readable without special attention. The standard form is not reasonably accessible for both reasons, and &#167; 2.02(c)(1) is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. B, a small mortgage lender with three employees, telephones A, a software manufacturer, and or- ders one copy of computer software to assist in the preparation and management of loan-closing docu- ments.

The packaged software delivered to B includes a paper copy of the stan- dard-form licensing agreement that is accessible without opening the software. The terms are not reason- ably accessible on A&#8217;s website prior to the transfer. A has not satisfied &#167; 2.02(c)(1) of these Principles.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Comprehensibility.</i> Subsec- tion (d) follows current law in striking incomprehensible terms. Incompre- hensible terms are &#8220;unintelligible&#8221; or ambiguous, use &#8220;obscure terminol- ogy,&#8221; conflict with each other, or lack certainty, even after the admission of extrinsic evidence. General contract law asks whether a reasonable person of average intelligence and education can understand the language with or- dinary effort, and this test should be applied here.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. B, a merchant with three employees, downloads a single copy of word-processing software from A, a software transferor. The standard form is reasonably accessible on the homepage of A&#8217;s website prior to the transaction. B clicks &#8220;I agree&#8221; at the bottom of a standard form pre- sented on a computer screen before the download begins. Nevertheless, the standard form, in garbled lan- guage, fails to clarify that A has conditioned B&#8217;s access to the word- processing software on B accepting another program consisting of spy- ware that will monitor B&#8217;s Internet activity and supply information to a third party. Under &#167; 2.02(d), the spyware terms are not reasonably <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>comprehensible and therefore not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Benefits of website disclosure.</i> These Principles adopt website disclo- sure as part of a package of best practic- es because it may be the best strategy for minimizing the problem of market failures in the retail-like, standard- form market for software. Transferors should follow the set of best practices to ensure enforcement of their stan- dard forms and because disclosure is inexpensive. At the same time, at least in theory, transferors will be unable to ignore the increased number of read- ers of standard forms and shoppers for terms. Transferors will also be mindful of watchdog groups that can easily ac- cess the standard form and can spread the word about the use of unsavory terms. Transferors therefore may be moved to write fair terms to preserve their reputations and market shares. Further, website disclosure enables transferees to read and compare terms before the excitement of a particular transaction deflects their focus from the terms. Software transferors will be unable to segregate readers and offer them better terms because of the large number of readers. Businesses in non- competitive industries also may want to write reasonable terms because of the volume of readers. In theory, prices should adequately reflect the quality of the terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Section 2.02(c) also supports eco- nomic-liberty reasons for enforcing contracts. The idea of individual assent is obviously more robust when trans- ferees have a reasonable opportunity to read and compare terms. As Karl Llewellyn suggested, such transferees have given their blanket assent to rea- sonable standard terms, regardless of whether they decide to read and shop for terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">As the primary strategy for deal- ing with market failures, website dis- closure also avoids difficult questions, such as the need to distinguish trans- ferees who should be relieved of their standard-form obligations from those who should remain bound. It is no sur- prise that transferees exhibit many different emotions and attitudes when they are e-shopping. The law cannot effectively distinguish those software shoppers who are capable of fending for themselves from those who, because of emotional or cognitive deficiencies, may fail to understand adverse terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Costs of website disclosure.</i> Website disclosure should be relatively inexpensive. The costs of maintaining a web homepage and displaying a stan- dard form should be insignificant, es- pecially because virtually all software transferors have or soon will have a web page. Nor should enforcement costs be high. &#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Will website disclosure suc- ceed?</i> The website-disclosure provi- sions of subsection (c), if followed, will fail to motivate transferors to write reasonable standard terms if transfer- ees still do not read and shop for terms or watchdog groups fail to spread the word or are otherwise ineffectual. Many commentators are not optimistic about disclosure as a remedy for mar- ket failures in standard-form contract- ing. They have observed the relative failure of truth-in-lending and other disclosure legislation. In addition, they have noted that, notwithstanding dis- closure, people still have rational rea- sons for failing to read their forms, decisionmaking processes that deter careful reading, and a limited ability to process all of the information they do read. In the software-contract setting, transferees also exhibit impatience and exuberance that stand in the way of a measured response to disclosed terms. In fact, if a transferee is not contem- plating an immediate transaction, she may find reading terms especially te- dious and worthless. Further, the bar- rage of new information that disclosure will make available on the Internet <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>may only increase the problem of infor- mation overload.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In addition, watchdog groups may be ill-equipped to police unsavory terms, either because they fail to iden- tify particularly problematic terms or because they fail to spread the word adequately because of their lack of in- fluence or the lack of exposure of their websites.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Perhaps the most ominous possibil- ity is that website disclosure will fail to increase transferee reading of terms, but will create a safe haven for busi- nesses to draft marginal ones. Most courts contemplating the enforcement of standard terms under doctrines such as unconscionability look for prob- lems with the bargaining process and with the substantive unfairness of the terms. The more outrageous the bar- gaining process, the more likely a court will strike a substantive term, and vice versa. In light of the judicial accep- tance of such a sliding scale, marginal terms that do not quite meet the test of substantive abuse may be enforce- able because of their disclosure on the website. In fact, there may be some justice to this approach, especially if competitors of the transferor offered better terms so that the transferee had a choice. After all, if a term is not sub- stantively unconscionable, is fully dis- closed, and the transferee had options, on what grounds should it be strick- en? Indeed, &#167; 1.11 of these Principles adopts the traditional sliding-scale ap- proach of unconscionability because of its soundness.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Nonetheless, increasing the enforce- ment of some marginal terms is a real concern. Still, affording transferees the opportunity to read and compare terms prior to a transaction as well as dur- ing or, in the case of shrinkwrap, some- times even after a transaction is likely the most promising of many imperfect solutions. Other methods of dealing with market failures run into numer- ous problems of their own. See supra the Summary Overview to Topic 2 of this Chapter. Further, disclosure is in- expensive and unlikely to impede com- merce even if it fails to resolve market imperfections. In addition, including businesses in the coverage of &#167; 2.02 should increase the incentive of draft- ers to write reasonable terms because businesses are more likely to read disclosed terms. And even if, in the short run, software transferors rely on &#167; 2.02(b) instead of (c) or benefit from disclosure more than transferees, even- tually the word should get out about a transferor who fails to disclose terms on its website and who continues to employ unsavory terms. Such a trans- feror&#8217;s incentives should change as it loses market share.</p>

B clicks &#8220;I agree,&#8221; at the end of a computer screen pre- senting the standard form before the download begins. A standard term allows the software transferor to &#8220;collect nonpersonal information about B&#8217;s web surfing and computer use.&#8221; The term may be substantive- ly suspect, but its disclosure prior to the transaction makes a determina- tion of unconscionability problemat- ic.

<p class="chap-title"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW CONSUMER CONTRACTS TENTATIVE DRAFT NO. 2 (2022)<sup>*</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Introduction:</b> Consumer contracts present a fundamental challenge to the law of contracts, arising from the asymmetry in information, so- phistication, and stakes between the parties to these contracts&#8212;the busi- ness and the consumers. On one side stands a well-informed and coun- seled business party, entering numerous identical transactions, with the tools and sophistication to understand and draft detailed legal terms and design practices that serve its commercial goals. On the other side stand consumers who are informed only about some core aspects of the transac- tion, but rarely about the list of standard terms. These consumers enter the transaction solely for personal or household purposes without any professional understanding of its legal contours.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, consumer contracts consist of core deal terms, which con- sumers readily identify as characterizing the transaction (such as price and payment methods, a shorthand description of the product, and a few others), and non-core standard contract terms, which cover a variety of provisions that the business seeks to apply to the transaction. Primary among these non-core terms are provisions that disclaim representations and warranties, limit consumer remedies, qualify the rights of consum- ers to bring legal actions, and authorize the business to collect, use, and share consumers&#8217; personal data. Such standardized terms are frequently referred to as the &#8220;fine print&#8221; or &#8220;boilerplate.&#8221; It is both irrational and infeasible for most consumers to keep up with the increasingly complex standard contract terms provided by businesses in the multitude of trans- actions, large and small, entered into daily. Courts expressly recognize the asymmetry between the parties when applying the principles of the common law of contracts to consumer transactions. How courts should address the asymmetry in particular contexts is the subject of this Re- statement.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many benefits to standard-form contracting, even in such asymmetric environments. The efficiencies of mass production and mass distribution of products and services would be hindered if the terms of each transaction with each consumer had to be individually negotiated. These market efficiencies can benefit all market participants, but the benefits of standard-form contracting are not without risks. Because con- sumers typically lack the information, sophistication, and incentive to monitor the terms appended to their transactions, there is a concern that businesses will include terms that are unreasonably one-sided, unfair, and inefficient. In the absence of scrutiny from their customers, businesses <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>might overreach and draft terms of agreement that undermine some of the value that consumers reasonably expected. Such overreaching might persist even in competitive environments. Accordingly, while the law views standard-form contracting as an effective form of creating legal obligations, it also contains various minimum requirements to protect consumers against overreaching by businesses.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>*</sup></b> This draft has been approved by The American Law Institute but is subject to revision in response to the discussion at the 2022 Annual Meeting and to editing for final publication.</p>
<p class="indent">In dealing with this fundamental challenge of potential abuse in asym- metric contracting environments, consumer-contract law deploys several protective techniques. The first set of techniques fits within the doctrine of mutual assent&#8212;the rules that determine how a contract is formed, which terms are adopted into the agreement, which terms are being mod- ified, and what processes a business must follow to alert consumers to the terms being introduced and to the consequences of their adoption. The second set of techniques involves mandatory restrictions over the substance of the deal&#8212;rules that limit the discretion of the business in drafting contract terms and set boundaries to the permissible terms of contracts. The third set of techniques concerns the alignment between the standard contract terms and the deal that consumers were led by the business to reasonably expect.</p>
<p class="indent">Questions relating to these protective techniques have emerged at the forefront of consumer-contract case law in recent decades. In the area of contract formation, technological advances have made it easier for business parties to draft and disseminate lengthy documents with (of- ten self-serving) contractual terms at the initiation phases of consumer transactions and to modify those terms periodically. Whereas shopping at a grocery store in the brick-and-mortar world entails very few stan- dard contract terms (and many legally supplied gap-fillers), shopping at the online outlet of that store now entails a lengthy list of standard terms. The proliferation of lengthy standard-term contracts, mostly in digital form, makes it practically impossible for consumers to scrutinize the terms and evaluate them prior to manifesting assent. A signature at the bottom of the form, a click of &#8220;I Accept,&#8221; or some other form of mani- festation of willingness to enter the transaction is, at best, a declaration that &#8220;I know I am agreeing to something, but I don&#8217;t know to what. I trust that if something really bad is buried in the fine print, the law will protect me from its bite.&#8221; In such environments, whether the lengthy terms are presented to the consumer before or after the decision to enter the trans- action has little bearing on the consumer&#8217;s awareness or understanding of the terms, as the process of review-and-scrutiny has become largely impractical. While courts have allowed businesses to design the format and timing of the presentation of standard contract terms, they require that reasonable notices be provided to consumers regarding the inclusion of these terms and their contractual nature.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing, however, that such notices have limited protective effect, a second set of protective techniques&#8212;policing the limits of permissible <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>contracting&#8212;has emerged at another frontier of consumer-contract law. As standard-form contracts increasingly replace long-standing default rules with provisions drafted by business entities, courts have been called upon to police their reach. Whether the terms are excessively one-sid- ed and unfair or diverge from the consumer&#8217;s reasonable expectations as shaped by the business&#8217;s marketing practices, common-law courts and consumer-protection statutes are establishing a framework for marking the boundaries. One possible approach to the marking of boundaries is a set of presumptions that certain provisions are unfair and unenforce- able. This approach, widely followed in foreign jurisdictions, has only limited presence in American law (see, e.g., Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;719(3)). Instead, under the common law, traditional doctrines like un- conscionability and misrepresentation have been applied to police suspect practices and terms relating to the subject matter of the transaction, the remedies that consumers or the business may seek when the transaction fails, choices of law and forum, the business&#8217;s discretion to specify and adjust contractual obligations, and to many other areas of contracting.</p>
<p class="indent">The third category of restrictions protects consumers from standard contract terms that negate or undermine consumers&#8217; reasonably expected benefits from the bargain. At the center of this category stand rules that give effect to representations, affirmations, and promises made to con- sumers, even when meticulous language in the standard contract terms purports to undo such effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the imbalance between businesses and consumers is so great, the application of contract law&#8217;s general rules of mutual assent and adop- tion of terms is not likely to level the playing field. In a world of lengthy standard forms, which consumers are unlikely to read, more restrictive assent rules that demand more disclosures, more notifications and alerts, and more structured templates for manifesting assent, while required by courts, are unlikely&#8212;even if businesses comply with them&#8212;to produce substantial benefit for consumers. Similarly, outside the common law, the Uniform Commercial Code&#8217;s rule that disclaimers of implied warranties become effective and are adopted as part of the contract only if made in a conspicuous manner has bred lengthy disclaimer paragraphs in ALL CAPS typeface, but again without curing the imbalance between the business and the consumer. As the length and incidence of standard-form contracts have grown, it has become all the less plausible to expect con- sumers to read and take informed account of the contracts&#8217; provisions. In these environments, strengthening the disclosure requirements emanat- ing from contract law&#8217;s general rules of mutual assent would not prompt consumers to read the terms, to carefully weigh them, and to ultimately make more prudent contracting decisions. Since advance disclosure of standard terms generally does not render the assent process any more meaningful, the &#8220;opportunity to read&#8221; technique, which courts have em- braced, is quite ineffective in consumer contracts. Some observers have even argued that mandating more disclosures might backfire by creating <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a false presumption of meaningful assent, thus undercutting the second policing technique&#8212;the ex post scrutiny of contract terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the limited effectiveness of the assent doctrine and of advance disclosure rules in producing environments of informed consent, courts have&#8212;without exception&#8212;endorsed and enforced standard-form con- tracts, as long as some necessary protective requirements are met. This Restatement states the requirements developed by common-law courts (based on traditional common-law contract principles) for the adoption of standard contract terms into consumer contracts. The requirements focus on the timing, format of presentation, context, process, flow, and substance of the notifications consumers receive regarding the existence of terms applying to the transaction. The goal of these court-developed requirements has been to afford consumers a meaningful opportunity to review the terms and to avoid the transaction, and thus ensure the valid adoption of these terms as part of the consumer contract. While some variation exists among courts and jurisdictions concerning the necessary substance and scope of the notifications accompanying the presentation of standard contract terms, this Restatement presents a comprehensive set of requirements unifying this common-law jurisprudence. Satisfaction of such requirements does not impose significant burdens on businesses or consumers interested in quick, streamlined completion of transactions. Adherence by businesses to these procedures would provide certainty surrounding the process of adoption of standard contract terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Meeting the threshold for adoption of the standard contract terms is not the only necessary step in creating enforceable contractual obliga- tions. Because the rules of mutual assent and adoption of standard con- tract terms are limited in their ability to protect consumers from abusive deals, common-law courts have sought to address the concern about po- tential abuse in asymmetric contracting environments through addition- al techniques. Beyond the minimum requirements relating to the manner in which the agreements are presented to consumers and to the conspicu- ousness of the alerts that consumers receive, courts have developed stan- dards under which intolerable terms are refused enforcement and have policed against deceptive acts even when terms pass through the filters of mutual assent and adoption. Through the common-law doctrines of unconscionability and reasonable expectations, courts have been limiting the effect of unfair standard contract terms. Accordingly, in addition to the rules governing the adoption of standard contract terms, this Restate- ment unifies and presents the primary common-law restrictions over the substance of those terms.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent decades, an important question regarding the scope of the unconscionability safeguard is the effect of limits (stipulated in standard contract terms) on the ability of consumers to pursue a complaint or to seek reasonable redress, particularly by channeling disputes to arbitra- tion or barring class actions. Many courts have held that imposing express <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>or de facto class-action bars on consumers is unconscionable, be- cause such limitations render the enforcement of low-stake individual contractual rights impractical. Recently, however, the enforceability of arbitration terms and class-action waivers has turned also on the provi- sions of various federal statutes. One such statute is the Federal Arbitra- tion Act (FAA), which has been held by the United States Supreme Court to preempt, in some cases, the application of the common-law doctrine of unconscionability to arbitration clauses.</p>
<p class="indent">The interpretation of the FAA and of other federal rules that regulate the procedures for consumers&#8217; access to justice is outside the scope of the common law of consumer contracts. This Restatement states the princi- ples that, in the absence of constraints of federal law, guide the applica- tion of the doctrine of unconscionability under state law. It thus takes no position on the proper application of the Federal Arbitration Act or other statutes governing enforceability of or limits on arbitration provisions and the way such statutes affect the application of the unconscionability standard.</p>
<p class="indent">The ex post scrutiny of permissible contracting, as well as the scrutiny of standard contract terms that conflict with other promises and repre- sentations made to consumers, are not intended to be (nor can they feasi- bly operate as) a replacement for private ordering. Parties are allowed to design their transactions, and standard contract terms&#8212;despite being in- visible to most consumers&#8212;are an indispensable part of the transaction. Parties may agree to bargain-basement terms, if they so wish, and for the right price. The ex post scrutiny by courts is only intended to uproot terms so unfair that they would be unlikely to survive in an environment of meaningful free choice or that stealthily peel off the value that consum- ers bargained for.</p>
<p class="indent">Consumer-contract law as developed by courts was famously charac- terized by Karl Llewellyn as consisting of two complementary prongs: first, manifestation of assent to, along with rigorous scrutiny to protect the spirit of, the bargained-for deal (&#8220;the dickered terms&#8221;), and, second, a fairly streamlined adoption of standard contract terms (the &#8220;supple- mentary boilerplate,&#8221; in Llewellyn&#8217;s words). Llewellyn recognized that the manifestation of assent to a consumer contract often results also in the adoption of standard contract terms even if the vast majority of con- sumers are not meaningfully informed of the content of these terms. This recognition has become all the more relevant and concerning in the dig- ital era, when businesses can draft longer lists of terms and attempt to incorporate them into the transactions more often. Llewellyn recognized that common-law courts enforce the standard contract terms only if they &#8220;do not alter or eviscerate the reasonable meaning of the dickered terms.&#8221; Karl N. Llewellyn, <i>The Common Law Tradition: Deciding Appeals</i> 370 (1960).</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>This Restatement offers a roadmap to the implementation and aug- mentation of Llewellyn&#8217;s approach, which continues to accurately char- acterize the approach taken by courts. At the front end, when consumer contracts are formed, courts require that consumers receive adequate op- portunity to review the terms (and adequate notices of this opportunity and of the fact that such terms would be part of the contract). At the back end, when consumer contracts are enforced, courts scrutinize the stan- dard contract terms to ensure that they are not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">This Restatement reflects the common-law &#8220;blanket assent&#8221; prin- ciple, whereby courts allow businesses to draft and affix standard con- tract terms to the transaction, as long as they provide consumers with adequate notices and opportunity to review the terms as well as a mean- ingful opportunity to avoid the transaction. At the same time, this Re- statement identifies the doctrines and rules arising from common-law jurisprudence, which restrict the effect of standard contract terms by pro- hibiting businesses from imposing intolerable terms or undermining the core bargain presented to consumers either as part of the dickered terms or in pre-contractual communications.</p>
<p class="indent">In restating the rules that apply contract law to consumer contracts, this Restatement relies on the common-law principles that have been guiding courts in adjudicating consumer contract disputes. Those prin- ciples were originally found in the Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts (and often reflect the statutory provisions of the Uniform Commer- cial Code) but have evolved and been applied by the courts in particular and important directions that are specific to consumer contracts and are restated in this Restatement.</p>
<p class="indent">When appropriate and consistent with the common law of contracts and the UCC, the rules of this Restatement also reflect the principles of fairness and anti-deception guiding consumer-protection statutes and regulations, just as the Uniform Commercial Code influenced provisions of the Restatement Second of Contracts. See Restatement of the Law Sec- ond, Contracts, Foreword. The principles that guide this latter body of law are derived from general policing doctrines of the common law and are manifested in several Sections of this Restatement that protect con- sumers by enforcing the bargain as presented to them, even when some elements are missing from, or qualified in, the standard contract terms. The two bodies of law that address consumer contracts&#8212;the general com- mon law of contracts and statutory and regulatory consumer-protection law&#8212;appear together in many litigated cases and have been implement- ed by the courts as a matter of contract law. The present document pro- motes a greater conceptual unity across these two branches of contract law. See Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375, 392 (1970) (&#8220;It has always been the duty of the common-law court to perceive the impact of major legislative innovations and to interweave the new legislative <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>policies with the inherited body of common-law principles&#8212;many of them deriving from earlier legislative exertions.&#8221;)</p>
<p class="indent">The challenges posed by consumer contracts have heightened over the past generation as courts have adapted traditional contract-law rules to consumer contracts. To track this development, this Restatement follows the traditional American Law Institute methodology and bolsters it with an additional layer of transparency. Primarily, this Restatement follows leading court decisions, eliciting from them the guiding rationales. It clar- ifies the policy goals underlying the rules applied by courts and develops their conceptual implications to accord them greater clarity and coher- ence. In addition, and in order to confirm that the rules identified through this primary method indeed reflect the &#8220;law in action,&#8221; the Reporters read the entire body of contract-law decisions relating to consumer contracts and a number of the rules of this Restatement&#8212;higher-court as well as lower-court decisions, both state-court and federal-court (applying state law) cases, published and unpublished, and holdings as well as dicta, made available in online legal-research directories and from secondary sources. By looking at all the information flowing from case law and care- fully organizing it according to outcomes, rationales, and influence, this methodology made it possible to examine with greater subtlety the emerg- ing rules, their impact, and their prominence. It decreases the possibility that important or well-reasoned cases may have been missed and allows a closer consideration of the evolution of the doctrine to better understand how courts are addressing key issues. We thus present a Restatement that reflects the rules as elicited from the most influential and persuasive court decisions, along with the assurance that these rules have indeed been widely accepted by the courts in the many jurisdictions throughout the United States. It is important to emphasize that the examination of the entire body of case law does not replace or modify the traditional legal analysis&#8212;the craft of discovering the DNA of the law through ex- perienced and informed reading of persuasive sources. Rather, the full landscape view bolsters the traditional approach with an added measure of comprehensiveness and transparency. The traditional method of legal reasoning is reflected in the black letter and explicated in the Comments to the Sections of this Restatement. The comprehensive analysis of the entire case law is explained and reported in Reporters&#8217; Notes accompany- ing the relevant Sections.</p>
<p class="indent">As explained above, this Restatement draws on common-law principles that have antecedents in the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts. The application by the courts of those existing principles in the area of consumer contracts produced the rules that are restated here. In restat- ing these rules in the consumer context, the present document seeks to provide courts with more tailored guidance in adjudicating consumer-con- tract disputes than the Restatement Second of Contracts offers, reflecting developments in consumer-contract law since the completion of the Re- statement Second of Contracts. Importantly, this Restatement does not <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>purport to cover all possible aspects of a consumer-contracts case. The Restatement Second of Contracts continues to provide valuable guidance on general contract-law questions in the consumer context that are not covered in this Restatement. Moreover, as the case law on consumer con- tracts continues to develop, this Restatement does not seek to cement the rules governing this body of law and stifle their evolution. Rather, the Restatement clarifies and unifies the principles that underly several decades of jurisprudence in the field, establishing a coherent basis for its further development.</p>
<p class="indent">This Restatement is organized as follows. Section 1 defines key terms, states the scope of this Restatement, and provides a roadmap of its struc- ture and provisions. The first substantive rule is the Adoption of Stan- dard Contract Terms provision in &#167; 2. The rule reflects an approach, widely embraced by a large majority of courts, that enables businesses to design the terms of the transaction, as long as they provide reason- able notice and meaningful opportunity to review the terms and to avoid the transaction. This rule is complemented by a related provision in &#167; 3, extending similar principles to the adoption of modifications of standard contract terms.</p>
<p class="indent">The remaining Sections comprise a set of rules that rely on ex post scrutiny by courts to limit the risk of abuse. Section 4 restates the prin- ciples of interpretation and construction from the Restatement Second of Contracts that are most relevant to consumer contracts, including in- terpretation against the drafter and the duty of good faith and fair deal- ing. Section 5 addresses the problem of open-ended terms, which grant the business unrestricted discretion to specify and adjust its obligations. Section 6 is the unconscionability rule, providing the framework for re- fusing enforcement of terms that unreasonably favor the business party and unfairly surprise the consumer. Section 7 deals with the problem of deception, whereby the standard contract terms conflict with explicit af- firmations or promises made to the consumer. Section 8 includes the rules regarding the legal consequences of pre-contractual affirmations of fact and promises. Section 9 creates presumptions of integration for standard contract terms (under the Parol Evidence Rule) and explains how such presumptions are rebutted by prior affirmations of fact or promises. And &#167; 10 completes this list of anti-abuse provisions by stipulating the effects of striking terms out of contracts and related remedies.</p>

<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. &#8220;Standard contract terms&#8221; defined.</i> The definition of &#8220;standard con- tract term&#8221; focuses on the pre-drafting factor, which captures a key feature of consumer contracts: their multi-trans- action application. Pre-drafting also implies that there is no negotiation be- tween the business and the consumer over the language of those terms. See &#167; 6(b)(2). In some cases, negotiation of the standard contract terms is present, as when the consumer has meaningful choice on which version of a pre-drafted standard term applies or is mean- ingfully able to choose to avoid a par- ticular subset of pre-drafted terms. In other cases, tailoring of the standard contract terms is present, as when the terms are tailored per consumer based on personal information or specific characteristics known to the business. Such negotiated or tailored terms are considered &#8220;standard contract terms&#8221; <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>despite the absence of uniform content because the method for specifying their content is set up by the business and has a multi-transaction application.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A credit-card issuer in- cludes a pre-drafted arbitration clause in the terms that it offers to all of its consumer customers. The arbitration clause is a standard con- tract term, as defined in subsection (a)(5), even if the contract provides that the consumer can prevent the term from becoming part of the con- tract by a notice to the business.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. An insurer offers different, non-negotiated premiums to differ- ent policyholders based on a for- mula that rates each policyholder&#8217;s risk. The premium is not negotia- ble. The term setting the premium is a standard contract term, as de- fined in subsection (a)(5).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer has a member- ship in a gym and is invited to adopt an additional standard contract term that entitles the consumer to an add-on package of 12 sessions of personal training for an addition- al $720. To entice the consumer to purchase the add-on, the authorized agent of the gym proposes, and the consumer agrees, to vary the add-on package and extend it to 15 sessions at no additional cost. The agent makes a hand-written correction on the preprinted Terms of Service sheet to reflect this accommodation. The term of the contract setting the number of sessions is not a stan- dard contract term, as defined in subsection (a)(5)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Core versus non-core terms of the deal.</i> Standard contract terms may include both terms that consumers readily identify as characterizing the transaction, or &#8220;core deal terms,&#8221; as well as terms that are appended by the business to the transaction, which ap- pear in fine print and which consumers do not appreciate and rarely scrutinize. Core deal terms often include price and payment methods, a shorthand description of the product, key delivery arrangements, and a few successful- ly communicated legal rights or lim- itations (for example, duration of the right to withdraw and receive a refund, or the length of the duration commit- ment in ongoing service contracts). The criteria for adoption and legal enforce- ability may vary according to this clas- sification of the standard contract term or the circumstances in which the term is provided to the consumer, and thus some rules of this Restatement may ap- ply differently to core versus non-core terms of the deal (for example, rules relating to adoption of terms under &#167;&#167; 2 and 3, unconscionability under &#167; 6, deception under &#167; 7, disclaimers under &#167; 8(c), and integration under &#167; 9).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A product is offered online for a fixed price. The listing of the product contains a description of the product, the price, the delivery charge, and a &#8220;30-day money-back&#8221; statement, as well as a link to the business&#8217;s website, where addition- al Terms of Purchase are posted. All are standard contract terms as defined in subsection (a)(5), even though only some of them&#8212;the price, the description of the goods, the delivery charge, and the &#8220;30-day money-back&#8221; statement&#8212;are core deal terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Same facts as Illustration 4, but the 30-day money-back state- ment is elaborated on in the addi- tional Terms of Purchase, which contain restrictions on the manner by which the money-back right may be exercised, including the manner by which the consumer must pres- ent the claim, the proof of purchase, and the condition the returned product must be in. These added <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>restrictions are not part of the core deal terms. (See also &#167; 2, Illustra- tion 2.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. &#8220;Affirmation of fact or prom- ise&#8221; defined.</i> The definition of &#8220;affir- mation of fact or promise&#8221; includes express statements, made in a written record or orally, as well as reasonable interpretations of express statements and implications that reasonably flow from express statements or acts. It also can result from an omission by the business, as when the business has reason to believe that the consumer reasonably but mistakenly expects a particular term or a particular benefit and fails to correct that expectation. (See &#167; 7(b) and Comment <i>2</i>.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Affirmations and promises can be found, for example, on a business&#8217;s website, on packaging materials, and in advertisements. The definition does not include statements that should be reasonably understood as &#8220;puffing&#8221; or statements of belief not founded on fact. See Restatement of the Law Sec- ond, Contracts &#167;&#167; 168&#8211;169; cf. Restate- ment of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Economic Harm &#167; 9, Comment <i>(b) (2)</i>, and Illustration 6 (&#8220;dealer talk&#8221; and &#8220;puff[ing]&#8221; do not provide a basis for a claim for a misrepresentation), and UCC &#167; 2&#8211;313(2). As explained in &#167;&#167; 7 to 9, an affirmation or promise can result in nonenforcement of incon- sistent standard contract terms (&#167; 7), can create an obligation that becomes part of the consumer contract (&#167; 8), and can rebut the presumption of partial or complete integration of the standard contract terms (&#167; 9).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. &#8220;Good faith&#8221; defined.</i> The defi- nition of &#8220;good faith&#8221; in this Restate- ment follows the current definition of &#8220;good faith&#8221; stated in Uniform Commer- cial Code &#167; 1&#8211;201(b)(20). Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 205 did not define &#8220;good faith&#8221; in the black let- ter. Comment <i>a</i> to that Section direct- ed attention to the definitions of &#8220;good faith&#8221; in Article 1 and Article 2 of the UCC, which were not identical. Since the completion of the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, the defini- tion in Article 1 (now in &#167; 1&#8211;201(20)) has evolved to follow the definition in Article 2 in effect at that time. Al- though various formulations and expli- cations of the duty of good faith have been adopted in different sources of law, they all share the same ultimate goal. The duty of good faith is intended to capture and weed out various forms of opportunistic behavior&#8212;including unfair and inequitable advantage-tak- ing, hold-up, manipulation, and dishon- esty&#8212;that undermine the reasonable expectations of the parties, reduce the value of contracting, and require cost- ly precautions. Good-faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasiz- es faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the rea- sonable expectations of the other par- ty. The element of &#8220;observance of rea- sonable commercial standards of fair dealing&#8221; is particularly necessary when businesses operate through agents and deal with numerous consumers. In these settings, unfair advantage-taking may occur even without dishonesty in fact. See Restatement of the Law Sec- ond, Contracts &#167; 205, Comment <i>a</i>.

<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. The reasonableness standard</i>. Numerous provisions throughout the Restatement depend on whether an ac- tion is &#8220;reasonable&#8221; or &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; or whether a party has acted &#8220;reason- ably&#8221; or &#8220;unreasonably.&#8221; The question of reasonableness is evaluated on the basis of the totality of the circumstanc- es and requires a fact-intensive analy- sis. For example, the analysis under &#167; 2 of whether a consumer received reason- able notice regarding the terms sought to be adopted as part of the contract in- cludes a review of factors such as the form and nature of the transaction; the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>clarity, sequence, flow, and simplici- ty of the communication of the terms; the design, layout, and content of the interface; the difficulty of identifying the notices and finding the location of the terms; the prominence of notices regarding important terms and their nature; and the visibility and clarity of the language alerting consumers that specific steps will result in the adoption of the terms as part of the contract with the business. See &#167; 2, Comment <i>2</i>. See also &#167; 3, Comment <i>3</i>. The use of a partic- ular contracting technology, font color, contrast, size, or type, capitalization, or graphic design or website design el- ements are relevant considerations un- der the &#8220;totality of the circumstances&#8221; test, but are not determinative. Com- pare the definition of &#8220;conspicuous&#8221; in UCC &#167; 1&#8211;201(10), which was revised in 2022 to eliminate the presumed con- spicuousness of terms of particular font sizes, colors, and contrasting types.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Likewise, the analysis under &#167; 6(d) whether a reasonable consumer is un- fairly surprised by a term includes a review of the bargain as presented to consumers, the manner in which the presence or the effect of the term was hidden or otherwise suppressed, the sophistication of the ordinary consum- er engaging in the type of transaction at issue, and the language used by the business. See &#167; 6, Comment <i>6</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Reasonableness of the contracting process is determined in light of the or- dinary behavior and perspective of con- sumers engaged in the type of trans- action at issue rather than evaluated against an abstract, aspirational stan- dard of consumer behavior. An evalua- tion of reasonableness includes consid- eration of the entirety of a consumer&#8217;s interactions with a business, including both prior transactions and the course of the instant transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The evaluation whether, under the circumstances, the reasonableness standard has been met involves ques- tions of fact and of law. If there is a dispute about the relevant facts, for example, whether under &#167; 2 an agent of the business alerted a consumer to the presence of the standard contract terms at the time in which the consum- er manifested assent, the factual dis- pute will be decided by the trier of fact. Once the facts are established, or in circumstances where they are not un- der dispute, a determination whether the adoption process meets the reason- able notice requirements in &#167; 2 is gen- erally made by the court. Such determi- nations are made based on the ordinary behavior and perspective of consumers engaged in the type of transaction at issue and their interaction with the business.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This definition applies to words de- rived from &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; such as &#8220;rea- sonably&#8221; and &#8220;reasonableness.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Scope.</i> The scope of this Re- statement derives from the definition of &#8220;consumer contract&#8221; (subsection (a) (4)). This Restatement contains con- tract-law rules that have distinct ap- plication to contracts in which asym- metries in information, sophistication, and bargaining power are present, of which consumer contracts are a prom- inent species. This Restatement does not purport to cover all possible aspects of such contracts. The Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, continues to apply to general contract-law ques- tions, including to questions relating to consumer contracts. In particular, the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, provisions on misrepresen- tation, duress, and undue influence, &#167;&#167; 159 to 177, and provisions on the ef- fect of adopting a writing, &#167;&#167; 209 to 218, are not displaced by this Restatement. Several provisions of this Restatement (&#167;&#167; 4, 7 to 9) provide specific guidance on the interpretation and construction of consumer contracts, with particu- lar emphasis on the meaning attached by lay consumers. These provisions elaborate on the Restatement of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Law Second, Contracts, provisions on interpretation, &#167;&#167; 200 to 218, but in case of conflict the specific rules of this Restatement take precedence over the general common-law rules of contract construction. This Restatement also applies to insurance contracts involv- ing consumers. Specific rules for the interpretation and enforcement of li- ability insurance policies are found in the Restatement of the Law, Liability Insurance, and in case of conflict those rules take precedence over the general rules of consumer contracts in this Re- statement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. Contracts over data and priva- cy.</i> A &#8220;consumer contract&#8221; is defined by the type of parties that enter it, not by the subject matter that it governs. Con- sumer contracts could govern a variety of topics, including the business&#8217;s data and privacy policies. Indeed, consum- er transactions often involve attempts by the business to form agreements governing the business&#8217;s treatment of consumers&#8217; personal information, in- cluding the business&#8217;s collection, use, sharing, protection, or other handling of personal information. Such matters have become an important economic component of many consumer trans- actions. While some privacy notices are required by law and some reflect obligations that are not contractual in their nature, and while the legal treat- ment of such aspects of the agreement may be subject to additional area-spe- cific rules (see, e.g., Principles of the Law, Data Privacy, Introductory Note), the business&#8217;s rights and obligations could also be governed by contract law and by the rules of this Restatement. Accordingly, this Restatement is not intended to determine which data or privacy policies or terms constitute or become part of contracts but merely to provide principles of contract law for those that do. Specifically, if the data and privacy terms are presented to con- sumers in a manner that satisfies the definitions of &#8220;contract&#8221; and &#8220;consumer contract,&#8221; courts should apply the rules of this Restatement (as well as other contract-law rules, but subject to spe- cific rules of data-privacy law) to deter- mine the formation, scope, consequenc- es, and enforceability of an agreement over data. This Restatement does not address whether there are also tort and other legal remedies available.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A consumer uses a busi- ness&#8217;s website to order a product. Before the purchase is complete, the website refers to the consumer two sets of standard contract terms that the website says will apply to the transaction. The first set of terms is titled &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; and covers several issues, including warranties, remedies, choice of law and forum, and intellectual proper- ty rights. The second set of terms is titled &#8220;Privacy Policy&#8221; and states the agreements of the parties with respect to the scope of personal data collection, use, sharing, and securi- ty. The provisions of &#167; 2 of this Re- statement that determine whether the &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; are adopted into the agreement also determine whether the Privacy Policy is adopt- ed into the agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>11. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and other statutory law.</i> This Restatement restates rules of the common law of consumer contracts. A significant number of consumer con- tracts are governed by statutes. Impor- tantly, sales or leases of goods are gov- erned extensively (but not completely) by Articles 2 and 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), and oth- er consumer contracts are within the scope of other UCC articles. Of course, the common-law rules set out in this Restatement cannot override statutory provisions of the UCC, and this point is made explicit in subsection (b) and explained here. When an issue is gov- erned by a UCC provision, interpretation <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of that provision is not within the scope of this Restatement. But the UCC does not create complete legal systems for contracts within its scope, and the common-law rules restated here apply to issues not addressed by the provisions of the statute. In some cases, the UCC is silent as to an issue and does not provide governing rules. In those cases, the UCC provides that common-law principles supplement the UCC unless displaced by particu- lar provisions of the UCC. (See UCC &#167; 1&#8211;103(b) and Comment 2 to that Sec- tion.) In other cases, even when there is a UCC rule generally applicable to a particular issue, the UCC rule does not answer all the questions that may arise in connection with that issue. Thus, many of the common-law rules set out in this Restatement, in addition to applying to non-UCC transactions, will have application to contracts with- in the scope of the UCC when no par- ticular provisions of the UCC address or displace them. In addition, many of the common-law rules set out in this Restatement are drawn directly from UCC provisions and from case law in- terpreting them that reflects a widely shared view as to the meaning and application of the UCC. See Uniform Commercial Code and Emerging Tech- nologies &#167; 2&#8211;102(5) (Tentative Draft No. 1, 2022) (&#8220;This Section does not preclude the application in appropri- ate circumstances of other law to the aspects of a hybrid transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods even if the sale-of-goods aspects of the trans- action predominate.&#8221;)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Certain other subsets of consum- er contracts, e.g., credit transactions, insurance contracts, real-estate con- tracts, or contracts involving invest- ments in securities, are partially governed by specific federal or state enactments. Consumer contracts for the sale of goods are also governed by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Many consumer contracts are covered by additional statutes and regulations, including the Federal Trade Commis- sion Act and state Unfair and Decep- tive Acts and Practices statutes. This Restatement provides common-law rules that supplement and implement the provisions of these enactments, but in case of conflict or displacement by statute, the statutory rules apply. The statutory rules take precedence also when the statute supplants the common law. The existence of a stat- ute, however, does not, in and of itself, supplant or displace the common-law rules restated herein. When an issue is governed by these enactments, the in- terpretation and scope of application of their provisions is not within the scope of this Restatement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In addition, this Restatement takes no position on the proper application of the Federal Arbitration Act or other statutory or regulatory requirements that may affect the enforceability of or limits on arbitration provisions, and the way such requirements may af- fect application of the stated contract principles. This Restatement includes some Illustrations and, in the Report- ers&#8217; Notes, some case citations that ref- erence arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. Those references are intend- ed to clarify the principles that guide the application of the rules relating to adoption of standard contract terms, to unconscionability, or other contract principles. They are not intended to address the relationship between these principles and the law of arbitration.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Parties to a consumer contract are also subject to additional common-law rules. See, e.g., Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Eco- nomic Harm; Restatement of the Law, Liability Insurance. In case of conflict, sector-specific common-law rules may take precedence over the general com- mon-law rules of consumer contracts that are restated herein.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 2. Adoption of Standard Contract Terms</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A standard contract term is adopted as part of a consumer con- tract if the business demonstrates that the consumer manifested assent to the transaction after receiving:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) reasonable notice of the term and of the intent to include the term in the consumer contract, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) reasonable opportunity to review the term.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) When a standard contract term is available for review only after the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, the standard contract term is adopted as part of the consumer contract if the business demon- strates that:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) before manifesting assent to the transaction, the consumer re- ceived reasonable notice regarding the existence of the standard con- tract term intended to be provided later and to be part of the consumer contract, informing the consumer about the opportunity to review and terminate the contract, and explaining that the failure to terminate would result in the adoption of the standard contract term;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) after manifesting assent to the transaction, the consumer re- ceived a reasonable opportunity to review the standard contract term; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) after the standard contract term is made available for review, the consumer received a reasonable opportunity to terminate the transaction without unreasonable cost, loss of value, or personal bur- den, and did not exercise that power.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) If the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, a contract is not rendered unenforceable if some of the standard contract terms are not adopted under subsections (a) and (b). In such a case, the terms of the contract are those adopted under subsections (a) and (b), and, if the consumer elects, any of the unadopted standard terms, along with terms, whether standard or not, to which both parties agreed, and terms sup- plied or incorporated by law.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. General</i>. This Section de- scribes the procedures for adoption of standard contract terms into consumer contracts. Adoption of standard con- tract terms is a separate legal conse- quence from the formation of a binding contract. A contract is formed when the parties manifest assent to a contractu- al relationship. When the contract is formed, standard contract terms may be adopted as part of the contract if the business can demonstrate that several requirements are met. This process of adoption of standard contract terms is sometimes also referred to as manifes- tation of assent to these terms, distin- guishing it from the manifestation of assent to a contractual relationship. Accordingly, when a consumer contract is formed, it may or may not involve the adoption (or assent to) the standard contract terms. This Section identifies minimum requirements for contracting procedures that result in the adoption <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of standard contract terms. It operates in a reality in which consumers, when manifesting assent to the transaction, are typically only aware of some &#8220;core&#8221; aspects of the transaction but are un- likely to read and exercise meaningful informed consent to the non-core stan- dard contract terms (see &#167; 1, Comment <i>5</i>). The adoption rules seek to preserve the convenience of streamlined con- tracting while providing consumers reasonable opportunity to scrutinize the standard contract terms and avoid unwanted transactions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Fact-intensive inquiry.</i> The reasonableness of any process of adop- tion of a standard term is based on the totality of the circumstances and requires a case-by-case, fact-intensive analysis in light of the ordinary be- havior and perspective of consumers engaged in the type of transaction at issue and their interaction with the business. The analysis of whether the consumer, who manifested assent to the transaction, has adopted the stan- dard contract terms includes a review of numerous factors, such as the form and nature of the transaction; the clar- ity, sequence, flow, and simplicity of the communication of the terms; the design, layout, and content of the in- terface; the nature of the transaction; the totality of the consumer&#8217;s interac- tions with the business; the difficulty of identifying the notices and finding the location of the terms; the prominence of notices regarding important terms and their nature; and the visibility and clarity of the language alerting con- sumers that specific steps will result in the adoption of the terms as part of the contract with the business, as well as the manner in which the consumer is asked to manifest assent to the trans- action and acknowledge the adoption of the standard contract terms. Thus, the form of the presentation of terms or of the invited manifestation of as- sent (sometimes referred to as &#8220;click- wrap&#8221; or &#8220;browsewrap,&#8221; online or in a brick-and-mortar setting) does not of itself determine whether the stan- dard terms have become part of the contract. Rather, the form embodies a bundle of factors for the court to con- sider when applying the general test. It may, in some circumstances, be more difficult to demonstrate satisfaction of the requirements of adoption in a &#8220;browsewrap&#8221; presentation, where the alerts provided to consumers about the proposed terms are often less visible, and where the connection between the action taken and the adoption of the terms is sometimes less clear. Similar- ly, where the form of the presentation itself does not communicate its con- tractual nature, for example, a check- out receipt at a retail store, the busi- ness may have to take additional steps to give the consumer reasonable notice that a contract is being formed. Recog- nizing, however, that despite the mini- mum guaranteed protective procedures required by this Section, consumers often enter into contracts without ap- preciating the presence or the effect of the standard contract terms, other Sections of this Restatement provide additional layers of protection against surprising and unfair outcomes (see Comment <i>14</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Adoption of standard terms may be separate from manifestation of assent to the transaction.</i> A consumer contract is not formed unless the con- sumer manifests assent to the transac- tion. A consumer may manifest assent to the transaction proposed by the busi- ness in any manner and by any medi- um reasonable in the circumstances. (See Restatement of Law Second, Con- tracts &#167;&#167; 30, 50.) This Section does not address the formation of the contract or the assent to the core terms. Once the contract is formed, this Section determines which standard contract terms are adopted. While in many in- stances the manifestation of assent to the transaction and the adoption of standard contract terms happen at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>same time, in other instances they may be done separately. Because the review of the entire body of standard contract terms is an uncommon practice for the great majority of consumers, and be- cause convenience in the method of de- livery of the terms benefits consumers and businesses alike, the adoption of standard contract terms can be made either together with or separate from the act of manifesting assent to the transaction. Standard contract terms may be presented to the consumer be- fore the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, at the same time that the consumer manifests assent to the transaction but before the product is delivered or the service is rendered, when the product is delivered, or when the service commences. Standard con- tract terms may also be presented in some combination of the foregoing. Accordingly, a single consumer con- tract may contain several &#8220;packets&#8221; of standard contract terms, each adopted in a different manner and at a differ- ent time (see Comment <i>8</i>). Manifesting assent to the transaction as a whole generally involves adoption of at least some standard contract terms&#8212;the core deal terms (see &#167; 1, Comment <i>5</i>; see also Comment <i>4</i> to this Section). Other standard contract terms may then be adopted separately from those that are adopted concurrently with the manifestation of assent.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A consumer uses a busi- ness&#8217;s website to purchase a prod- uct. To complete the transaction, the consumer must enter payment information and click the &#8220;Pur- chase&#8221; button. On the same check- out page appears a statement &#8220;This transaction is governed by Terms and Conditions&#8221; linking to another webpage that instructs the consum- er where and how to view the ad- ditional Terms and Conditions. By clicking &#8220;Purchase&#8221; the consumer manifests assent to the transaction and a contract is formed. If the no- tices regarding the Terms and Con- ditions and the procedures for their adoption satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) or (b), these addi- tional standard contract terms are adopted as part of the contract. If they do not, the contract formed by clicking &#8220;Purchase&#8221; does not contain the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A consumer rents a car at an airport counter and concludes the transaction by signing a printed sheet titled &#8220;Rental Contract.&#8221; The rental rate and description of the vehicle are prominently displayed on the front of the sheet. The con- sumer&#8217;s signature manifests assent to the transaction and constitutes the adoption of the core deal terms (which, in car-rental contracts, typi- cally include the rental rate, the de- scription of the vehicle, and the type of insurance provided). Additional standard contract terms are pre- sented on the back of the sheet, and a notice referring to their inclusion is posted adjacent to the signature line in a prominent fashion. If the notice satisfies the requirements of subsection (a), those terms are ad- opted concurrently with the mani- festation of assent to the transaction via the signature. If, in addition, other standard contract terms are presented to the consumer after the time of signature&#8212;for example, in an email sent to the consumer some time later&#8212;those terms may be ad- opted under subsection (b) separate- ly from the manifestation of assent to the transaction (see Comment <i>6</i>), if the requirements of subsection (b) are met.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Manifesting assent to the transaction and adoption of &#8220;core&#8221; terms.</i> A consumer may manifest as- sent to the transaction proposed by the business in any manner and by any me- dium reasonable in the circumstances. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>In inviting the consumer to enter a transaction, the business may estab- lish how the assent may be manifested, as long as the manner and medium are reasonable in the circumstances and it is reasonably communicated to the consumer that assent will be manifest- ed in the specified manner and by the specified medium. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 30, 50.) Most often, assent to the transaction is manifested by signing an agreement, paying, or clicking &#8220;Purchase Now&#8221; or &#8220;I Agree&#8221; after the consumer has been put on reasonable notice that such ac- tions would result in the formation of a legal obligation. Absent such effective communication&#8212;for example, when the consumer may reasonably think that proceeding with the activity does not create a legally binding obliga- tion&#8212;the consumer does not manifest assent to a consumer contract. When manifesting assent, the consumer is usually aware only of the core deal terms. Such core deal terms often in- clude price and payment methods, a shorthand description of the product, key delivery arrangements, and a few successfully communicated legal rights or limitations (for example, the right to receive refund of airline fares or the length of the duration commitment in service contracts). In assenting to the transaction, the consumer adopts the core deal terms&#8212;many of which are standard contract terms under the definition in &#167; 1(a)(5), but some may be nonstandard&#8212;as part of the contract. Non-core standard contract terms may be adopted simultaneously (under sub- section (a)) or upon the expiration of a reasonable review period (under sub- section (b)).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">3. A product is offered online for a fixed price. The listing of the product contains several core deal terms, including a description of the product, the price, the delivery charge, and a &#8220;30-day money-back&#8221; statement. Additional Terms of Purchase are presented to the con- sumer in fine print and contain pro- visions that qualify and limit the manner by which the 30-day mon- ey-back right may be exercised. The core deal terms, including the 30- day money back promise, are adopt- ed as part of the contract when the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, for example, by click- ing &#8220;I agree to purchase.&#8221; The addi- tional Terms of Purchase, including those that qualify the money-back term, are non-core terms and may be adopted when the consumer manifests assent under subsection (a) or at a later time under subsec- tion (b), if the provisions of these subsections are satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Adoption of terms reasonably available for review prior to manifest- ing assent to the transaction.</i> When the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, a consumer contract is formed. The consumer contract in- cludes the core deal terms (those which, from the perspective of the consum- er, characterize the bargain) as well as other standard (and nonstandard) contract terms reasonably available for review prior to manifesting assent. Subsection (a) identifies the process for the adoption of standard contract terms that are available for review pri- or to the manifestation of assent. Some of these standard contract terms may be explicitly presented to the consum- er in the course of manifesting assent to the transaction (see Illustration 4). Other standard contract terms may be presented elsewhere, but as long as the business demonstrates that the consumer received reasonable notice of them, including reasonable notice that they are intended to be part of the transaction and that manifesting assent would constitute a legally bind- ing adoption of those terms, and had a reasonable opportunity to review them, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>they are adopted when the consumer manifests assent to the transaction (see Illustrations 6&#8211;9). The application of the standards for reasonable notice and opportunity to review that apply to terms that are not explicitly acknowl- edged in the course of affirmatively manifesting assent may be more exact- ing (see Comments <i>2, 10</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer uses a busi- ness&#8217;s website to purchase a prod- uct. To complete the transaction, the consumer must click an &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button. Immediately ad- jacent to the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button is a statement in a clear and reason- ably prominent font: &#8220;By clicking on this button, you are accepting the Service Agreement in the box be- low.&#8221; Below the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button is a scroll-down text box labeled Ser- vice Agreement, which contains the standard contract terms. The con- sumer is able to click &#8220;I Agree&#8221; even without scrolling all the way down the box. The website&#8217;s presentation does not allow the consumer to com- plete the purchase without clicking &#8220;I Agree.&#8221; The consumer manifests assent to the transaction by clicking the button. The standard terms in the Service Agreement contained in the scroll-down box are adopted as part of the contract under subsec- tion (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. Same facts as Illustration 4, but the statement adjacent to the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button does not mention the Service Agreement and instead says: &#8220;You understand that by click- ing the &#8216;I Agree&#8217; button you are pro- viding us written permission to ob- tain information from your personal credit profile.&#8221; By clicking &#8220;I Agree&#8221; the consumer does not adopt the standard contract terms in the Ser- vice Agreement. Such notice, how- ever prominently placed, does not inform the consumer that the click, which is said to provide one specific authorization, also constitutes ac- ceptance of the Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Same facts as Illustration 4, but the Service Agreement incor- porates by reference a separate list of Privacy Policy terms. The follow- ing statement appears in clear type in the first paragraph of the Service Agreement: &#8220;Additional binding terms related to our Privacy Pol- icy are available <u>here</u>,&#8221; linking to another web page with the Privacy Policy terms. The consumer&#8217;s man- ifestation of assent to the transac- tion (by clicking &#8220;I Agree&#8221;) encom- passes the additional Privacy Policy terms, and those standard terms are adopted as part of the contract under subsection (a). If, instead, the statement referring the consumer to the Privacy Policy appears not with- in the Service Agreement but in a separate, inconspicuous place on the checkout page, it is not adopt- ed as part of the contract because it does not reasonably inform the con- sumer that clicking &#8220;I Agree&#8221; to the Service Agreement also constitutes acceptance of the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A consumer opens an ac- count with a web retailer and clicks an &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button immediately be- low the Terms of Service but does not make a purchase. The Terms of Service appear in a text box in the middle of the page and state promi- nently that they apply to all subse- quent purchases made by the con- sumer using the account. Later, the consumer makes a purchase on this website using the account and pur- suant to the earlier-adopted stan- dard terms by clicking &#8220;Purchase&#8221;, without additionally and specifi- cally assenting to any terms other than the description of the product, the price, and the delivery method. The standard contract terms in the Terms of Service are part of the con- tract formed under subsection (a) at <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the time of the purchase because the consumer was notified about their intended adoption and they were available for review in a rea- sonable manner before the consum- er manifested assent to the specific purchase transaction (see Comment <i>9</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A consumer uses a web- site to order a product. During the checkout process, the consum- er is presented with the core deal terms&#8212;the description of the prod- uct, the price, and the shipping arrangement.

When the con- sumer clicks &#8220;Purchase Now,&#8221; the linked terms are adopted as part of the contract under subsection (a) be- cause reasonable notice of the terms and the intent to include them in the consumer contract, as well as a reasonable opportunity to read them, have been given. If, instead, the link to the additional terms is placed at the bottom of the checkout page, in muted coloring, in font less conspicuous than other features on that page, without additional notice that the terms are meant to be part of the contract, then the additional terms are not adopted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A consumer enters a dry cleaner&#8217;s store.

The sign states that the store is not responsible for damage to items occurring in the ordinary course of the cleaning process. When the consumer manifests assent to the transaction by completing the drop-off process and receiving an acknowledgment of the order, the standard contract term posted on the sign is adopted as part of the contract under subsection (a).</p>

The process of replacing the opportunity to read prior to assent with a reasonable post-as- sent review period and termination right allows the parties to enter trans- actions with greater ease and without sacrificing any meaningful protection that advance reading of the contract provides. Subsection (b) validates this process, under which terms are adopt- ed if the business demonstrates that the consumer received: (1) reasonable notice before manifesting assent to the transaction that additional standard contract terms will be presented after manifesting assent to the transaction, including reasonable notice that such terms are intended to be part of the transaction; (2) reasonable opportunity to review the terms upon their arrival; and (3) the opportunity to terminate the entire transaction without unrea- sonable cost, risk, or personal burden. The majority of courts do not require all the notices listed in subsection (b) (1), focusing instead on the reasonable opportunity to review and terminate in subsections (b)(2) and (3). To bolster consumers&#8217; opportunity to review the standard terms, this Restatement en- dorses the more restrictive approach, adopted by a minority of courts, requir- ing that before manifesting assent to the transaction, the consumer must be reasonably notified about the opportu- nity to review the newly available stan- dard contract terms and to terminate <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the transaction, and that failure to ter- minate would result in the adoption of the standard contract terms.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">10. A consumer orders a prod- uct from a business by signing an agreement that contains the core deal terms and making a payment. On the form, a clearly visible state- ment immediately above the signa- ture line informs the consumer that additional standard contract terms will be arriving at a later time and will become part of the contract if the consumer does not return the product. Later, along with the deliv- ered product, the consumer receives the additional standard contract terms that include an express war- ranty statement and limitations on remedies. The terms appear inside an envelope labeled &#8220;Terms and Conditions&#8221; affixed to the product. They contain a clear, prominent statement that the consumer has a right to return the product within 30 days if she does not agree with the terms, and that reasonable re- turn shipping costs will be paid by the business. The standard contract terms are adopted as part of the contract under subsection (b). The same result applies if the Terms and Conditions arrive separately from the product, e.g., with a wel- come letter delivered by mail, as long as the letter provides reason- able notice that it is related to the purchase of the product and that it contains terms that govern that transaction, as well as reasonable notice of the opportunity to termi- nate the transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Adoption of terms by entry to, or use of, a proprietary environment of the business.</i> Standard contract terms governing the proprietary environment of the business&#8212;whether physical or digital&#8212;may be adopted as part of a consumer contract upon entry to, or continued use of, that environment, even if no purchase is concluded while in the environment. The deliberate act of entering the business&#8217;s proprietary environment and remaining in it long enough to gain access to the content and benefits it confers could constitute a manifestation of assent by the con- sumer to a transaction if the consumer is reasonably so informed. The trans- action consists of the right to use the proprietary environment and receive the benefits it is reasonably expected by an ordinary consumer to confer, un- der the terms specified by the business, including terms that specify the rights of the business and the obligations of the consumer, as long as the consumer has reason to know that the continued use of the proprietary environment was offered subject to contractual agree- ment to those terms. The consumer has a reason to know if provided with reasonable notice that use of the pro- prietary environment (including the use upon recurring entries) is governed by legally binding standard contract terms, which the consumer then has a reasonable opportunity to review (see Comment <i>9</i>). If such notice of the legal effect and opportunity to review is rea- sonably provided to the consumer prior to entry, the standard contract terms are adopted upon entry. If, instead, the notice and opportunity to review, along with notice of the contractual effect of continued use, are provided only after entry (for example, when the consum- er enters the business&#8217;s website and is only then able to access a link gov- erning the use of the website, or when, upon entry, an alert appears with said notice), the manifestation of assent to the transaction and the adoption of the terms occur upon the continued use of the proprietary environment and the receipt of its benefits. In such a case, the consumer must receive reasonable notice that continued use will consti- tute adoption of the terms as a binding contract, a reasonable opportunity to review the terms, and a reasonable opportunity <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to exit without being bound to the terms. Cf. Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 69(1)(a) (the taking of the benefit of offered services can serve as a manifestation of assent by the recipient). Assent to the trans- action and adoption of the standard contract terms are effective only if the consumer has a reasonable opportuni- ty to terminate the transaction without being bound (thereby satisfying the &#8220;reasonable opportunity to reject&#8221; re- quirement of &#167; 69(1)(a)).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">11. A consumer parks her car in a private parking lot. A promi- nent sign at the entrance to the lot states that a $10 per hour charge will be collected upon exit from the lot and that the business is not re- sponsible for damage to the vehicle while parked in the lot. By entering the lot, the consumer manifests as- sent to the transaction concerning the use of the parking lot, and the terms posted on the sign are adopt- ed under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. A consumer visits a de- partment store. A prominent sign posted at the entrance to the store&#8217;s parking lot states that parking is free while visiting the store and that the store is not responsible for damage to the vehicle while parked in the lot. The consumer parks the car in the lot and browses the store&#8217;s aisles but does not make a purchase. Upon exit, the consumer discovers that the car was damaged. By entering the lot, the consumer manifests assent to the transaction concerning the use of the parking lot, and the standard contract terms posted on the sign are adopted un- der subsection (a). If, instead, the same sign is posted in the store it- self, its terms are not adopted as part of the contract, because the opportunity to exit and avoid being bound to the terms now involves cost and inconvenience that are un- reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. A consumer enters an in- formation-service website&#8217;s home page for the purpose of gaining ac- cess to its information content with- out creating an account or making a purchase, and without checking a box or clicking a link evidencing as- sent to any agreement. At the top of the home page, a notice is posted in large font, underlined, and in con- trasting color: &#8220;By continuing past this page, you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use for this site.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;Terms of Use&#8221; is under- lined and highlighted. If clicked, it directs the consumer to a page that contains the full Terms of Use. By continuing past the home page, the consumer manifests assent to the transaction concerning the use of the website, and the Terms of Use are adopted under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. A consumer is directed from Website A, a search platform where users can search and access information from numerous sourc- es, to linked content appearing on Website B, a separate informa- tion-service website. Initially, when clicking on the link that appears on Website A, only the first paragraph of the content on Website B&#8217;s page is visible, with a &#8220;Read More&#8221; but- ton obscuring the remainder of the content. A notice prominently ap- pearing near the &#8220;Read More&#8221; but- ton states that the use of Website B is governed by standard contract terms. Clicking on the &#8220;Read More&#8221; button allows the consumer to en- ter and to access the full content of Website B&#8217;s page. By clicking &#8220;Read More&#8221; the consumer manifests as- sent to the transaction with Web- site B governing the access to the content posted on the page. If the consumer can view the terms prior to clicking &#8220;Read More&#8221; (for exam- ple, if a link to the terms appears <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>within the notice), the standard contract terms are adopted under subsection (a). If, instead, the con- sumer can only view the terms after clicking &#8220;Read More&#8221; (for example, a prominent link to them appears at the bottom of the full-content page), the terms may be adopted under subsection (b), but only if the con- sumer has a reasonable opportunity to reject the application of the terms by exiting the full page of Website B&#8212;and does not do so.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. The possibility of multiple con- tracts.</i> A single manifestation of assent could result in multiple contracts if the requirements of this Section are sat- isfied for each of those contracts. The additional contract is formed only if the consumer can reasonably expect that a legally binding relationship with an- other business may form, so as to avoid imposing on the consumer an unwant- ed additional contractual relationship. The consumer must be specifically notified that by manifesting assent to the transaction, an additional contract with this or another party will be creat- ed.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In particular, in connection with a purchase at a retail store, it is pos- sible and convenient for the consum- er to enter, by one act of manifesting assent, into two contracts&#8212;one con- tract with the retailer and a second contract with the manufacturer of the purchased product (and thus avoid the inconvenience of multiple affirmative acts of manifesting assent). At times, the terms governing the second con- tract, offered by the manufacturer of the product, are available for review prior to the manifestation of assent, for example, when they are presented to the consumer as part of the descrip- tion of the product before checkout and payment to a retailer. In such cases, subsection (a) determines whether the terms are adopted. Other times, the terms provided by the manufacturer are available to review for the first time only after the consumer manifests as- sent to the transaction. In such cases, subsection (b) determines whether the terms are adopted. Under either case, the terms offered by the manufacturer are adopted if the consumer receives reasonable notice, before manifesting assent to the transaction, that a sep- arate contract with the manufacturer will be formed and that the manifes- tation of assent to the transaction will apply also to this additional contract. And, under either case, the require- ments of either subsection (a) or sub- section (b) must also be met in order for the standard contract terms offered by the manufacturer to be adopted. An at- tempt to impose on the consumer a con- tractual relationship with a third party without satisfying the requirements of this Section, including a failure to rea- sonably alert the consumer to the pres- ence of a separate contract, would not result in the creation of a contractual relationship with the third party, and the offered terms would not be adopted. Such an attempt may also be relevant under &#167;&#167; 6, 7, and 9.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">15. A consumer purchases a product at an online store and, at the checkout screen, manifests as- sent to a list of standard contract terms governing the transaction with the retailer, which are promi- nently offered for review prior to the transaction. In addition, a notice on the screen titled &#8220;Additional Terms of Sale&#8221; appears in a manner rea- sonably visible to the consumer, in- structing that by clicking &#8220;Purchase Now&#8221; the consumer is accepting terms stipulated by the manufactur- er, which are available in a printed booklet inside the box. In the book- let, at the top of the first page, the consumer is informed of her right to return the product within 30 days at no cost if she does not agree with the terms. In this scenario, two consumer <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>contracts are formed by man- ifesting assent to the purchase at the retail outlet. The first contract is with the retailer and contains the core deal terms as well as the stan- dard contract terms that the retail- er has specified, in accordance with subsection (a). The second contract is with the manufacturer, assent to which is also manifested at the time of purchase. It contains the stan- dard contract terms specified by the manufacturer, and they are adopt- ed at the end of the 30-day return period, in accordance with subsec- tion (b).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. A consumer purchases from a dealer a new car, which is delivered with a three-month tri- al subscription for satellite radio. When the consumer manifests as- sent to the purchase, no reference is made concerning a separate con- tract with a satellite-radio service or the intent to adopt terms govern- ing that service. A month after the purchase, the consumer receives a Service Agreement by mail from the satellite-radio business, notify- ing the consumer about the stan- dard contract terms governing the service. Since the customer had no notice prior to the manifestation of assent to the transaction with the dealer that such manifestation of assent would apply also to a sepa- rate contract governing the satel- lite-radio service, and that the stan- dard contract terms governing this service would be mailed, no contract is formed between the consumer and the satellite-radio business. The standard contract terms mailed to the consumer concerning the sat- ellite-radio service are not adopted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Combined use of different adoption processes.</i> A business might use different adoption processes for different sets of terms within a single consumer contract. For instance, the business may present some standard contract terms in advance and ask the consumer to explicitly acknowledge them in the course of manifesting as- sent to the transaction (e.g., by clicking &#8220;I Agree&#8221;) and may present other stan- dard contract terms in a separate for- mat, which the consumer is not asked to affirmatively acknowledge (e.g., the other terms may be posted on a website or packaged with the product). Thus, it is possible to adopt some standard contract terms under subsection (a) and others under subsection (b). The combined adoption of different sets of terms occurs if the requirements for adoption under either subsection (a) or (b) are fully satisfied for each set of terms.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. A consumer in State A uses a website to create a service account. The consumer is asked to click &#8220;I Agree&#8221; at the bottom of a scroll box titled &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; in which some standard contract terms are presented. Immediate- ly adjacent to the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button appears a clearly labeled, easily identifiable statement: &#8220;Addition- al terms relating to subscribers in State A will be sent to you within 72 hours. They will become part of your contract with us unless you notify us within 14 days of your decision to cancel your account.&#8221; By clicking &#8220;I Agree&#8221; the consumer manifests assent to the transaction and adopts the terms presented in the scroll box under subsection (a). The additional terms are adopted under subsection (b) if the consum- er does not cancel the account with- in 14 days of their presentation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. Reasonable notice and oppor- tunity to review.</i> The consumer must receive reasonable notice of the intent to adopt the standard contract terms and a reasonable opportunity to review the terms. An evaluation of the effect of the notice is based on the totality <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the circumstances and requires a case-by-case, fact-intensive analysis, in light of the reasonableness standard. See &#167; 1(a)(8) and Comment <i>8</i>. In the case of an online transaction, as part of the court&#8217;s evaluation of the process and presentation of the transaction, a business claiming that the terms were adopted under subsection (a) will have to demonstrate that the sequence and content of the screens seen by the con- sumer at the time the consumer en- tered into the transaction afforded the consumer a reasonable opportunity to review the terms, including a reason- able indication that they are intended to be part of a legally binding trans- action to which the consumer is man- ifesting assent. As part of evaluating the totality of the circumstances and the reasonableness of the notice, the characteristics of the contracting par- ties may also be considered (e.g., when a product or service is offered to a small segment of especially sophisticated consumers). (Cf. UCC &#167; 1&#8211;202 (defining &#8220;Notice&#8221;).) See generally &#167; 1(a)(8) (defi- nition of &#8220;reasonable&#8221;) and Comment <i>8</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The evaluation whether, under the circumstances, reasonable notice was provided involves questions of fact and of law. If there is a dispute about the relevant facts, for example, whether an agent of the business alerted a con- sumer to the presence of the standard contract terms at the time in which the consumer manifested assent, it will be decided by the trier of fact. If there is no dispute concerning the relevant facts, including, for example, when the digital interface seen by the con- sumer during an online transaction is recorded and undisputed, or if the fac- tual dispute has been resolved by the trier of fact, a determination whether the proven adoption process meets the reasonable notice requirements in &#167; 2 is generally made by the court.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">18. A consumer visits a busi- ness&#8217;s website to purchase a prod- uct. During the checkout process, the consumer enters her credit-card information and shipping address and is then required to click &#8220;I agree to purchase.&#8221; The business places a link to Terms and Conditions at the bottom of every one of its web pages, including at the bottom of the checkout page. The text in the link is in a font smaller than the one used in the rest of the website, and on the checkout page the link can only be seen and accessed by scrolling down the page, otherwise it is not visible when the consum- er clicks &#8220;I agree to purchase.&#8221; The link does not provide reasonable notice, and therefore the linked terms are not adopted as part of the contract. If, instead, there is a prominent, stand-alone notice in a central portion of the checkout page in contrasting, large font, not blended with or obscured by other notices, stating that the transaction is subject to Terms and Conditions that are noticeably linked for the consumer to access, all visible when the consumer clicks &#8220;I agree to pur- chase,&#8221; then the terms are adopted as part of the contract under sub- section (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">19. A purchase agreement is drafted by the business to be pre- sented to consumers on the busi- ness&#8217;s website but is sometimes presented to consumers as a paper printout at the business&#8217;s service desk in a department store. On the online version, the consumer is asked to click &#8220;I Agree&#8221; at the bottom and informed that clicking will form a contract, and on the pa- per-printout version the consumer is asked to affix a signature next to the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; box. Immediately above the location of the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; click, there is a phrase stating &#8220;Additional <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Terms.&#8221; In the online ver- sion, the phrase &#8220;Additional Terms&#8221; appears as a link, in distinct color font, which, if clicked, opens a page with the additional terms. In the paper-printout version, the phrase &#8220;Additional Terms&#8221; appears in an underlined, pale font, and no other information is provided as to what this phrase implies or how to ac- cess the additional terms. The link appearance in the online version provides the consumer reasonable notice and opportunity to review, and the additional terms are ad- opted once the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, under subsection (a). The pale, underlined phrase in the paper-printout ver- sion does not provide the consumer reasonable notice and opportunity to review, and the terms are not adopted under subsection (a). In addition, referring a consumer to a link in a paper version may not give the consumer reasonable notice of the terms. If, instead, along with the printout version the consumer receives an explicit notice that the Additional Terms are contractual and apply to the transaction and could be obtained by asking the sales clerk for a readily available copy for the consumer to review, the terms are adopted under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">20. A consumer purchases a product at a retail store. During checkout, the consumer signs a form titled &#8220;Agreement,&#8221; which in- cludes the store&#8217;s General Terms and Conditions. Later, upon un- packing the product, the consumer finds attached a brochure from the manufacturer that contains the manufacturer&#8217;s standard contract terms, including an End User Li- cense Agreement for the software installed on the product. No advance notice was given to the consum- er about these &#8220;terms in the box&#8221; during the purchase process with the retailer or on the box presented to the consumer prior to purchase. Because such notice is lacking, the terms in the brochure are not adopt- ed as part of the consumer contract. If, instead, there was prominent no- tice, either on the box or presented by the retailer, that further terms were available for review once the consumer opened the box, the notice requirement would be satisfied. In such case, the terms in the brochure could be adopted under subsection (b) (subject to notice of the consum- er&#8217;s right to terminate the transac- tion within a reasonable time after reviewing the terms; see also Com- ment <i>11</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">21. A consumer visits a busi- ness&#8217;s website to order a service. During the checkout process, the consumer is presented with a scroll window with the heading &#8220;Service Agreement&#8221; in which the first two lines of the agreement&#8217;s text are visible. Below the scroll window, a paragraph in bold text explains that by clicking &#8220;Accept and Con- tinue&#8221; the consumer authorizes the business to obtain the consumer&#8217;s personal credit profile from a third party. It does not state that by clicking &#8220;Accept and Continue&#8221; the consumer also adopts the &#8220;Service Agreement.&#8221; The consumer mani- fests assent to the transaction by clicking the &#8220;Accept and Continue&#8221; button. The terms in the &#8220;Service Agreement&#8221; are not adopted as part of the contract because the consum- er did not receive reasonable notice that assent applies to the &#8220;Service Agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">22. A consumer purchases a product at a retail store. During checkout, the consumer is present- ed with a 120-page brochure titled &#8220;Operation Manual.&#8221; The brochure contains instructions from the man- ufacturer on how to use the product. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>It also contains, on page 97, an arbitration agreement applying to the contract with the manufactur- er. Because the presentation of the brochure as a &#8220;Manual&#8221; does not in- clude any language indicating that standard contract terms affecting the consumer&#8217;s rights are included in the Manual, there is no reason- able notice of the existence of the standard contract terms, and they are not adopted as part of the con- tract under subsection (a). Even if the brochure&#8217;s cover page indicated that it included standard contract terms, the difficulty in locating the terms may prevent the consumer from having reasonable notice of those terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">23. A consumer signs up for in-flight Wi-Fi service. On the &#8220;cre- ate account&#8221; page, immediately be- low the boxes in which the consum- er is instructed to enter personal information appears a prominent &#8220;NEXT&#8221; button that takes the con- sumer to a web page on which the consumer is instructed to enter credit-card information. Above the &#8220;NEXT&#8221; button, the following state- ment appears in small font that is not distinguished&#8212;by size, color, or typeface&#8212;from other text on the screen: &#8220;By clicking &#8216;NEXT&#8217; I agree to the <i>terms of use</i> and <i>privacy pol- icy</i>.&#8221; The words &#8220;terms of use&#8221; and &#8220;privacy policy&#8221; are hyperlinks and, if clicked, would take the consum- er to web pages that include the business&#8217;s terms of use and privacy policy, respectively. The consumer clicks &#8220;NEXT,&#8221; completes the regis- tration process, and proceeds to use the in-flight Wi-Fi service. There is no reasonable notice of the existence of the standard contract terms, and they are not adopted as part of the contract under subsection (a). If instead the statement above the &#8220;NEXT&#8221; button were made conspic- uous through the use of large, dif- ferently colored font (or large, bold- faced font), the notice requirement would be satisfied and the terms of use would be adopted under subsec- tion (a).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">24. A consumer installs an application on a smartphone and is prompted to enter personal infor- mation in a sequence of screens. In the middle of the last screen, where the consumer is asked to provide payment information, appears a conspicuous &#8220;Register&#8221; button that the consumer must click to complete the installation. Immediately below that button and in large, contrast- ing, and conspicuous font, against an otherwise uncluttered back- ground, there is a statement noti- fying the consumer that by clicking the &#8220;Register&#8221; button the consumer is agreeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, both of which are hyperlinked and underlined in contrasting colors. There is reason- able notice of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy under subsection (a) because their placement makes them easy to find and the design, placement, and language of the ad- jacent text make it clear that the standard terms are intended to be part of the transaction when the consumer chooses to register with the website.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>11. Reasonable opportunity to ter- minate.</i> Under subsection (b), the con- sumer must be given a reasonable op- portunity to terminate the transaction and reasonable notice of the right to terminate. To be reasonable, the dura- tion of the review-and-terminate peri- od has to provide sufficient time for the consumer who is interested in review- ing the terms to complete a meaning- ful review. In addition, the consumer&#8217;s opportunity to terminate the transac- tion after receiving the terms must not place unreasonable cost, loss of value, or personal burden on the consumer. If a reasonable right to terminate is <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>granted, the consumer&#8217;s choice not to terminate constitutes the adoption of the standard contract terms. Effective termination by the consumer discharg- es the contract to which the consumer manifested assent.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">25. A consumer visits a store to purchase a product. At the reg- ister, a posted sign states that ad- ditional terms apply to the trans- action and can be obtained on-site at the customer-service desk. If the service desk is nearby and readily accessible without undue delay or hardship, and if the store allows the consumer to terminate the transac- tion after receiving the additional terms and reasonably notifies the consumer of the right to terminate, then they are adopted under sub- section (b). If, however, the addi- tional terms are not readily avail- able upon the consumer&#8217;s request, or if the consumer is not allowed to reasonably terminate the trans- action after payment or is allowed to terminate but not reasonably no- tified about the right to terminate, the additional terms are not adopt- ed as part of the consumer contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">26. A consumer purchases a computer online for $500. Prior to the purchase, a notice that satisfies the requirements of subsection (b)(1) is provided. When the computer is installed, a set of standard con- tract terms is displayed on-screen. The terms, which are lengthy and complex, allow the consumer five days to return the computer and avoid being bound by the terms. The standard contract terms are not adopted as part of the contract because five days is not a reason- able time to perform the logistics required to return a computer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">27. Same facts as Illustration 26, but the consumer has 30 days to return the computer. The terms further specify that if the consum- er returns the computer, the refund will be only partial, as the business reserves the right to charge a cer- tain restocking fee. Even if the re- stocking fee is reasonable from the seller&#8217;s standpoint in light of the handling and depreciation costs, it nevertheless unreasonably restricts the opportunity of the consumer to terminate the contract upon review of the terms. Accordingly, the stan- dard contract terms are not adopted as part of the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">28. Same facts as Illustration 26, but the consumer has 30 days to return the computer, and there is no restocking fee. The terms fur- ther specify that if the consumer re- turns the computer, the consumer will bear the return shipping cost. The shipping cost may be reason- able, but it nevertheless unreason- ably restricts the opportunity of the consumer to terminate the contract upon review of the terms. Accord- ingly, the standard contract terms are not adopted as part of the con- tract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">29. Same facts as Illustration 26, but the consumer purchases the computer at the business&#8217;s local re- tail store (rather than online), and the terms specify that the consum- er may return the computer to the local retail store for a full refund within 60 days. Even though driv- ing back to the retail store imposes some cost or burden on the consum- er, this cost or burden is not unrea- sonable. In such a case, the &#8220;oppor- tunity to terminate&#8221; requirement of subsection (b)(3) is satisfied. If, however, the store only accepts re- turns during limited hours, or only when the box is unopened, the op- portunity to terminate is unreason- ably restrictive, and the standard contract terms are not adopted as part of the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>12. Legal consequences of non-adopted terms.</i> Standard terms that fail to conform to the adoption-process re- quirements of subsections (a) or (b) do not become part of the consumer con- tract. In such a case, under subsection (c), if the consumer manifested assent to the transaction there is a contract that contains the terms&#8212;standard and nonstandard, including the core terms&#8212;that were effectively adopted, supplemented by gap-fillers supplied by law. A consumer, however, may choose not to assert that, in light of the protec- tions provided by subsections (a) and (b), the intended contract terms were not adopted. Because the requirements of this Section are intended to provide consumers a reasonable opportunity to review the terms, a consumer may choose to get the benefit of any or all of the standard contract terms. If the consumer so chooses, the business may not assert that these standard contract terms were not adopted. (Compare &#167; 7 for the consumer&#8217;s right to enforce as part of the consumer contract an affir- mation of fact or promise that does not appear in the standard contract terms.)</p>

Same facts as Illustration 26, but the standard contract terms include a statement by the business that information about the transac- tion will not be provided to any oth- er third party. The business, in vi- olation of that statement, provides information about the transaction to a third party, to the detriment of the consumer. While the standard contract terms are not adopted as part of the contract, the consumer may assert a claim for breach of a contractual promise as embodied in the non-adopted statement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>13. Mandatory rule.</i> The rules restated in this Section specify man- datory requirements of assent, notice, and opportunity to terminate and can- not be excluded or derogated from by agreement. A business is free to speci- fy the precise manner or medium that the manifestation of assent, notice, and termination take, as long as they are reasonable in the circumstances. If the business specifies a process for adopt- ing standard terms that does not meet these mandatory requirements, that process is not effective, and the stan- dard terms it purports to adopt are not adopted as part of the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>14. Relation to other Sections.</i> The adoption rules in this Section reflect the reality in which the consumer&#8217;s consent to the standard contract terms is rarely informed. In classic contract law, the requirement of assent was regarded as a meaningful mechanism that protects the contracting party, un- der the premise that this party, with full knowledge of the terms and with sufficient understanding of their im- pact, would manifest assent only to a contract that promotes his or her in- terests. The length and complexity of standard-form contracts, and the large number of such contracts consumers enter into, have diluted the effective- ness and plausibility of such front-end self-protection. Accordingly, it is wide- ly recognized that adoption procedures designed to achieve informed consent would yield relatively little value to, and might even impose burdensome transaction costs upon, the consumer. Courts have thus recognized the impor- tance of safeguards in consumer-con- tract law. Primary among these are the rules that strike down unconscio- nable terms and other standard con- tract terms that undermine consumers&#8217; benefit of the bargain (&#167; 6). Adding to the protection afforded by the uncon- scionability doctrine are the good-faith duties that govern contract modifica- tion and open discretionary terms (&#167;&#167; 3 and 4) and rules that police deception and enforce pre-contractual affirma- tions and promises (&#167;&#167; 7 to 9). See also &#167; 1(e) (outlining the provisions of this Restatement). If, despite reasonably <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>communicated disclosures, consumers are not expected to scrutinize the legal terms up front, courts should scruti- nize them ex post. The ex post scrutiny is intended to uproot terms that are so one-sided that they would be unlikely to survive in an environment of mean- ingful assent or that peel off the value that consumers bargained for.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>15. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and to the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts.</i> The com- mon-law rules restated herein are con- sistent with, and elaborate on, the gen- eral principles of contract formation as articulated in Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, Chapter 3. In addition, a majority of courts have in- terpreted UCC &#167; 2&#8211;204 in this context in a consistent manner. With respect to adoption of terms after manifesting assent to the transaction (subsection (b)), some courts have interpreted UCC &#167; 2&#8211;207 to bar adoption of those terms as part of the consumer contract. Most courts, however, reject that interpre- tation of UCC &#167; 2&#8211;207 and, as those courts have determined that no oth- er provisions of Article 2 address the question of which post-purchase terms become part of the contract, apply in- stead UCC &#167; 2&#8211;204 and&#8212;through the gateway provided by UCC &#167; 1&#8211;103(b)&#8212;general common-law principles. With respect to the adoption of standard contract terms by entry to or continued use of a proprietary environment, the rule of this Section is consistent with Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 69(1)(a), which allows silence to operate as an acceptance when the offeree &#8220;takes the benefit of offered ser- vices with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation.&#8221; See Comment <i>7</i>.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 3. Adoption of a Modification of Standard Contract Terms</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A modification proposed by the business of a standard contract term in a consumer contract governing an ongoing relationship is adopted if the business demonstrates that:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) the consumer received reasonable notice of the proposed mod- ified term and a reasonable opportunity to review it;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the consumer received a reasonable opportunity, including reasonable notice of the opportunity, to reject the proposed modified term and continue the contractual relationship under the existing term, and;</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) the consumer received reasonable notice that continuing the contractual relationship without rejecting the proposed modified term will result in the modification being adopted; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) the consumer either:</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) manifested assent to the modified term, or</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) did not reject the proposed modified term and continued to take the benefit of the contractual relationship after the expiration of the rejection period provided in the proposal.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A consumer contract governing an ongoing relationship may provide for a reasonable procedure for adoption of modified terms under which the business may propose a modification of the standard contract terms but may not, to the detriment of the consumer, exclude the application <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of subsection (a), except that the established procedure may replace the reasonable opportunity to reject the proposed modified term with a reasonable opportunity to terminate the transaction without unreason- able cost, loss of value, or personal burden.</p>

<p class="indent">(d) Standard contract terms may not be modified in a consumer con- tract that has been substantially performed by at least one party.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. General.</i> Standard contract terms in consumer contracts govern- ing ongoing relationships, like other species of contracts, are often modified. This Section focuses on the minimum requirements for the process of adop- tion by the consumer of modifications to the standard contract terms, where- by the consumer is determined to have agreed to a modification of a standard contract term. Similar principles may apply to the modification of nonstan- dard terms. Many modifications may be justified by changes in the econom- ic or legal environment, by revisions in the service itself, or by the realiza- tion of other unexpected contingen- cies. There is a concern, however, that businesses will initiate self-serving, op- portunistic modifications in standard contract terms once consumers are al- ready locked into the service. Accord- ingly, for a modification to be adopted, it is not enough that consumers have manifested their assent to the modified standard terms after the terms have been presented to them. Consumers may manifest such assent reluctant- ly, if termination of the contract would squander some acquired value, would unreasonably undermine their reliance investments, or would be practically infeasible. Thus, this Section provides three necessary safeguards, procedur- al and substantive. First, procedural- ly, under subsection (a), the process of adoption of a modification must satis- fy requirements of assent analogous to those in &#167; 2 (including the require- ment, analogous to that in &#167; 2(b), that the consumer receive a reasonable op- portunity to reject the modification and continue the contract on the original terms). Subsection (b) allows the par- ties, usually at the instance of the busi- ness, to establish in the initial contract a reasonable modification procedure that implements these assent require- ments, although it may replace the op- portunity to reject with a reasonable opportunity to terminate the transac- tion entirely (see Comment <i>6</i>). Second, under subsection (c), the modification may not undermine the benefit of the bargain secured in the pre-modification contract. It must be proposed in good faith and be fair and equitable, which means that the business must have an objectively demonstrable legitimate reason for the modification (see Com- ment <i>7</i>). Third, under subsection (d), a contract that has been substantially performed may not be modified (see Comment <i>8</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This provision does not replace Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 89, nor does it address other issues that may apply in the context of agreement over a modification, such as the requirement of consideration, formalities, and other requirements <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>referred to in Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 89, and Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 2&#8211;209. Nor does this Section address modifications pro- posed by the consumer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Modification versus indepen- dent contract.</i> New terms proposed by the business are, depending on the cir- cumstances, either an attempt to mod- ify the terms of an existing contract within an ongoing relationship (gov- erned by this Section) or an attempt to form a new, independent contract alongside or in succession to the orig- inal contract (governed by &#167; 2).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A consumer opens a check- ing account with a bank and signs a user agreement. The bank seeks to change the terms of the agree- ment occasionally and sends notices to the consumer in advance of each such change. Each change of terms is a modification proposed under this Section, not a new contract. This is so even if the original agree- ment allows the bank to terminate the contract at any time, as long as the bank did not effectively termi- nate the original contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A consumer signs up for an ongoing web-based service, creating an account and manifesting assent to the transaction by agreeing to pay the monthly service fee and providing credit-card information. The website displays links to Terms of Use, which are referred to during the sign-up process and are adopt- ed as part of the consumer contract upon the initial formation of the contract under &#167; 2(a). The consumer can review the terms by clicking on the links. The business changes the Terms of Use from time to time and sends the consumer notices upon each such change. Each change is a proposed modification governed by this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer signs up for a one-year service period with a business. If the contract requires fresh assent to renew the service at the end of the year, new terms sent upon renewal are not a modi- fication; their adoption is governed by &#167; 2. If, instead, the contract pro- vides for auto-renewal for a second year, unless the consumer explicitly terminates the service, the original contract continues to govern during the second year, and any different or additional terms sent upon the renewal or during the second year are a proposed modification of the original contract and are governed by this Section.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer uses a web- site without creating an account or making a purchase. The website has a link to Terms of Use in large, contrasting font on the lower por- tion of the site, which the consum- er can see immediately upon open- ing the page and without scrolling down the page. The consumer can review the terms by clicking on the link, and there is a clear notice that the terms are intended to become part of the contract governing the current use of the website. The con- sumer visits the website regularly. The business changes the Terms of Use from time to time. The current standard terms may be adopted as a new contract each time the consum- er visits the website if the require- ments of &#167; 2 are satisfied each time, and do not constitute a modification of a prior contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Reasonable notice and oppor- tunity to review.</i> As with the adoption of original terms under &#167; 2, modified standard contract terms may be adopt- ed only if the consumer receives rea- sonable notice of the new terms and a reasonable opportunity to review them. A general notice of the possibility of fu- ture modifications is not sufficient. In addition, the consumer must receive <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>reasonable notice of the opportunity to reject the modified terms (which is discussed in Comment <i>4</i>), along with reasonable notice that continuing the contractual relationship without re- jecting the modified terms will result in the modifications becoming legally binding. The factors listed in &#167; 2, Com- ment <i>2</i>, including appearance, place- ment, layout, and timing of the notice; the clarity, sequence, and simplicity of the communication of the terms; the difficulty of identifying and finding the location of the terms; the prominence of notice regarding important terms and their nature; the visibility and clarity of the language alerting consumers that specific steps will result in a mod- ification of the terms; and the nature of the proposed modified standard con- tract terms determine whether, consid- ering the totality of the circumstances, the notice and opportunity to review and reject are reasonable. The evalua- tion whether, under the circumstances, reasonable notice, an opportunity to re- view, and an opportunity to reject were provided involves questions of fact and of law. If there is a dispute about the relevant facts, for example, how or when the proposed change of terms was presented to the consumer, it will be decided by the trier of fact. If there is no dispute concerning the relevant facts, for example, in circumstances where the digital interface seen by the consumer during the proposed mod- ification is recorded and undisputed, a determination whether the proven adoption process meets the legal re- quirements in &#167; 3 is generally made by the court. See generally &#167; 1(a)(8) (defi- nition of &#8220;reasonable&#8221;) and Comment <i>8</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A consumer entered into a two-year service contract online. At the time of the original contract formation, standard contract terms were adopted by satisfying all the requirements of &#167; 2(a), including reasonable notice of the Terms and Conditions. The business later posts a modified version of the Terms and Conditions on its website, revising the heading in the page on which the terms are posted and entitling it &#8220;Revised Terms and Conditions.&#8221; If the business does not provide the consumer with a distinct or sep- arate notice of the modification, describing specific changes to the agreement and the effective date of those changes, the new terms are not adopted as a binding modifica- tion. It is not reasonable to expect consumers to revisit and check the Terms and Conditions web page regularly, and, in the absence of an affirmative, reasonable alert, the consumer does not have a reason- able opportunity to review the pro- posed modification as required by subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A consumer opens a check- ing account with a bank and signs a 20-page user agreement. The bank seeks to change the terms of the agreement occasionally and sends notices to the consumer in advance of each change. Each such notice arrives with a monthly statement sent to the consumer on a separate sheet titled &#8220;Change of Terms&#8221; that describes specific changes to the agreement and the effective date of those changes. The presentation of the proposed modification in this manner satisfies the reasonable no- tice requirement of subsection (a) (1).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Same facts as Illustration 6, but the bank seeks to change the terms by attaching to the monthly statement the revised version of the 20-page agreement entitled &#8220;Re- vised Agreement,&#8221; which includes most of the terms in the original agreement as well as some addi- tional or different ones. There is no explanation or indication as to which terms are being changed or <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>added. The presentation of the pro- posed modification in this manner does not satisfy the reasonable no- tice requirement of subsection (a) (1), because consumers cannot read- ily compare and analyze two such lengthy and technical documents and thus cannot effectively review the proposed modification. See &#167; 2, Comment <i>10</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Opportunity to reject the modi- fication.</i> A modification is binding only if the consumer has a meaningful op- portunity to reject it. Subsection (a)(2) requires that the modified terms not be adopted unless the business gives the consumer a reasonable opportu- nity (with reasonable notice) to reject the modification and continue the rela- tionship without the new terms. There is a close conceptual relationship be- tween adoption of standard terms after the consumer manifests assent to the transaction under &#167; 2(b) and adoption of a modification of standard terms un- der this Section&#8212;in both settings, the standard contract terms are present- ed to the consumer after a decision to enter into the transaction was already made. Accordingly, the adoption of the standard contract terms in both set- tings has to satisfy a similar require- ment: the existence of a reasonable opportunity to reject. Such opportunity requires affording the consumer a rea- sonable time period in which to exer- cise such rejection, as well as a reason- able rejection process.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">8. A consumer attempts to log in to an online web service that the consumer joined as a member at an earlier time. The consumer is unable to log in without first click- ing &#8220;I Accept&#8221; to a list of new terms that are presented as a modification of the original contract. Since the consumer is not given an opportu- nity to reject the modification, the terms are not adopted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A consumer receives a clearly labeled notice by mail re- garding a change of the data-privacy terms governing an ongoing service. The notice informs the consumer that continued use of the service and acceptance of its benefits will constitute acceptance of the terms and a modification of the contract. It also explains that the change of terms will not apply, and the orig- inal terms will remain in place, if the consumer requests an opt-out within 30 days by signing and sub- mitting a pre-addressed opt-out form provided in the notice. The specified procedure for rejection of the modification is reasonable, and the requirement of subsection (a)(2) is satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. A business providing digi- tal services conducts all its commu- nications with the consumer elec- tronically. The consumer receives from the business an electronic notice regarding a change of terms governing the service. The notice informs the consumer that in order to reject the proposed modification the consumer must print out a re- jection form and mail it to the busi- ness&#8217;s physical address. In light of the mismatch between the ordinary form of communications and the required rejection procedure, the specified procedure for rejection of the modification is not reasonable, and the requirement of subsection (a)(2) is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Adoption of the modified stan- dard contract terms</i>. With the receipt of reasonable notice of the proposed modification, reasonable notice that continuing the contractual relation- ship without rejecting the modified term will result in the modification be- coming legally binding, and a reason- able opportunity to reject it, the mod- ification is effective if the consumer either affirmatively manifests assent to it or continues to take the benefit of <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the relationship (without rejecting the proposed modification). Subsection (a)(3) thus recognizes that the consumer can adopt the modified term by con- duct that can fairly be treated as con- stituting acceptance. It maintains the dual-adoption framework of &#167; 2, under which terms may be adopted either by an affirmative act of acceptance or by continuation of the relationship and continuing to accept its benefits after the terms are presented. In some cases, the conduct that adopts the modifica- tion is the consumer&#8217;s continued partic- ipation in the contractual relationship, e.g., in a credit-card contract when the consumer makes new purchases using the credit card. In such cases, the mod- ification is adopted through acceptance by performance. Cf. Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 30, 62.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">11. A consumer enters a pay- as-you-go agreement with a fitness club. Months later, the business sends the consumer a notice by mail titled &#8220;Change of Terms of Service&#8221; describing particular changes to the agreement and giving the consum- er 30 days to opt out of the modi- fied terms (and retain the original terms). If the consumer does not exercise the opt-out option, the new terms are adopted as a modification as soon as the 30-day opt-out period elapses.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. Agreed procedures for modifi- cation.</i> Businesses often include in con- sumer contracts &#8220;modification clauses&#8221; that specify procedures for subsequent modifications. Such clauses may give concrete effect to the requirements of subsection (a) but cannot derogate from them, except that the agreed procedure for modification may replace the oppor- tunity to reject in subsection (a)(2) with a reasonable opportunity to terminate the transaction entirely. An opportuni- ty to terminate is reasonable if it does not impose unreasonable cost, loss of value, or personal burden on the con- sumer. If termination of the contractu- al relationship by the consumer is not feasible or practicable&#8212;for example, because such termination would im- pose a significant loss of value acquired by the consumer prior to the proposed modification; would force the consumer to incur a significant financial or other burden to enter a substitute contract; would squander a substantial invest- ment in the relationship; or would un- dermine the consumer&#8217;s reasonable, forward-looking expectation from the relationship&#8212;then the consumer does not have a reasonable opportunity to terminate. In such a case, the modified standard terms are usually not adopt- ed, even if the consumer manifested assent to the modification. In evaluat- ing whether the costs imposed on the consumer by the modification are rea- sonable, courts may take into account the circumstances that prompted the business to propose the modification, including an increase in the business&#8217;s costs; changes in market, technology, or regulatory environments; and improve- ments to the service provided by the business. If the modified terms confer substantial benefits, as in the example of new terms that are needed to accom- modate an upgrade to the business&#8217;s computer systems, the evaluation of the reasonableness of the opportunity to terminate must consider those bene- fits in relation to any cost, loss of value, or personal burden that a termination would impose on those consumers who prefer the original terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Modification clauses that grant the business power to modify standard terms without meeting the mandatory requirements of this Section are inef- fective, and any modification attempt- ed under such clauses is unenforceable by the business. See &#167; 10.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">12. A consumer attempts to log in to an online web service that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the consumer joined as a member at an earlier time. The original con- tract includes a modification proce- dure. The consumer is unable to log in without first clicking &#8220;I Accept&#8221; to a list of new terms that are present- ed as a modification of the original contract. Since the consumer is not given an opportunity to reject the modification when seeking to log in, the terms are not adopted unless the consumer is provided a mean- ingful opportunity to cancel the membership (for example, by click- ing on a reasonably identified sep- arate hyperlink that takes the con- sumer to a &#8220;Service Cancellation&#8221; page) and unless such termination can be done without the consumer incurring unreasonable cost, loss of value, or personal burden.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">13. Same facts as Illustration 12, but the cancellation options&#8212;al- though clearly posted and processed without delay&#8212;trigger an early-ter- mination fee (adopted as part of the original contract). Because of the imposition of a termination fee, the consumer is not offered a reason- able opportunity to terminate the transaction, and so the new terms are not adopted.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">14. A consumer purchases a camera system for home surveil- lance. At the same time, the con- sumer enters a one-year service agreement that allows the consum- er to stream the images recorded by the camera to a handheld device through an integrated streaming service separately provided by the business. The agreements include a modification procedure. A few months later, the business sends the consumer a notice explaining that the Terms of Service for the service agreement will be modified in 30 days, that continuing the ser- vice will constitute acceptance of the new terms, and that the terms may be rejected by cancelling the service before the end of the 30 days. Despite the reasonable notice and cancellation method, the oppor- tunity to terminate the contractual relationship is not reasonable un- der subsection (b) because termina- tion of the service agreement would impose a significant loss of value of the camera equipment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">15. A consumer entered a six-month service agreement with a snow-removal company to plow the consumer&#8217;s driveway after each snowfall for a fixed price of $100. The agreement includes a modifi- cation procedure. Two months into the contract, the consumer receives a letter stating, &#8220;Due to the high demand for plowing services, we are modifying the contract with you by raising the price for plow- ing your driveway after each snow- fall to $150. If you do not want to pay us $150, you may terminate our relationship by sending us an email to that effect within 14 days.&#8221; Because termination of the trans- action would entail a loss of value, the opportunity to terminate is not reasonable under subsection (b), and thus the consumer&#8217;s failure to terminate the transaction within 14 days does not create an enforceable modification. In addition, the modi- fication is separately unenforceable under subsection (c) because modi- fication would have the effect of un- dermining the promise to plow for $100, which is part of the basis of the original bargain. Agreements incorporating a flexible price formu- la may be enforceable. See &#167; 10.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. Same facts as Illustration 15, except that the agreement does not include a modification proce- dure. The modification would be unenforceable under subsection (a) because the consumer is not provid- ed with a reasonable opportunity to reject the modification. In addition, the modification is separately unenforceable <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>under subsection (c) be- cause modification would have the effect of undermining the promise to plow for $100, which is part of the basis of the original bargain.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. A consumer subscribes to a web-based service that pro- vides a no-charge, ad-free platform for uploading and sharing photos. The original agreement includes a clause stating that the ad-free fea- ture of the service may be revised in the future. It also includes a modifi- cation clause that permits the busi- ness to change the terms of service any time in the future, subject to providing the consumers an oppor- tunity to terminate the subscription upon such change. Later, in order to ensure its commercial viability, the business decides to switch to a per- sonalized-advertisement model that uses subscribers&#8217; personal data. It proposes a modification explaining the change and the type of data that will be collected. The offer to modify gives the consumer an option to ac- cept the new terms or terminate the contract by deleting the account. The opportunity to terminate is reasonable despite imposing some inconvenience on consumers who choose to delete the account.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Fairness and good faith.</i> Mod- ifications must be made in good faith, and must be fair and equitable. See Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 89 (adopting the &#8220;fair and equi- table&#8221; test); UCC &#167; 2&#8211;209 (adopting the &#8220;good faith&#8221; test). A modification affects the performance of the contract, and it is thus governed by the general obliga- tion to perform contracts in good faith. See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 205; see also UCC &#167; 1&#8211;304. It is restated in subsection (c) because of the heightened role that it plays in policing modifications of consumer con- tracts. The fair and equitable provision in subsection (c) is intended to ensure that the modification does not undu- ly disadvantage the consumer or add a surprising element to the contract, even if the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) have been met. In partic- ular, subsection (c) seeks to prevent opportunistic modifications that take advantage of locked-in consumers who have already invested in the contrac- tual relationship. Thus, a modification of a standard contract term is not en- forceable if it undermines the benefit of the bargain guaranteed by the original contract, as when it contradicts an af- firmation of fact or promise by the busi- ness that has been made part of the basis of the original bargain between the business and the consumer. Such contradiction may occur, for example, when the business has promised in the original agreement or in a pre-contrac- tual representation (see Comment <i>9</i>) that the standard contract term will not change for a fixed period of time. See also Illustrations 18 and 19. Even if the consumer is afforded the oppor- tunity to terminate the relationship without unreasonable cost, loss of val- ue, or personal burden (in line with an agreed-upon modification procedure under subsection (b)), the modification is not enforceable if the termination undermines the benefit of the bargain guaranteed by the original contract. In general, a modification is more likely to satisfy subsection (c) if the modified standard terms are simultaneously be- ing offered, as original terms, to new customers. Then, there is less con- cern that the modification intends to take advantage of consumers who are locked in by the cost of changing the deal. Nevertheless, because the same term may affect entrenched consumers differently than new ones, it may be enforceable as part of the contract with new consumers but not as a modifica- tion. Thus, an important implication of subsection (c) is that some standard terms that may be acceptable if pre- sented as part of the original contract may not be enforceable if presented as part of a proposed modification.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">18. A consumer opens a check- ing account with a bank and signs a standard-form checking account agreement. The agreement specifies a fixed fee to be charged whenever a consumer draws a check from an ac- count with insufficient funds. Later, the bank proposes a modification that would raise this fee prospec- tively. The consumer manifested assent to the modified term, or the agreement provided an appropriate procedure for the proposal of modifi- cations, such that the requirements of subsection (a)(4)(A) or of subsec- tion (b) are satisfied. The amount by which the bank may propose to in- crease the processing fee is limited by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">19. A consumer purchases and downloads hundreds of song tracks from an online music store along with software that is necessary to play the tracks. The initial contract adopted as part of the purchase of the tracks states that the consumer may load the tracks to seven differ- ent devices. Later, together with a mandatory software update, the business proposes a modification that allows the consumer to load the tracks only to five devices. If the new, five-device clause applies only to prospective track purchases by the consumer, it does not violate subsection (c). If, instead, the new clause applies also to tracks already paid for, it violates subsection (c) because it retroactively reduces the consumer&#8217;s benefit from the bargain and partially squanders the con- sumer&#8217;s investment in previously purchased tracks.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Substantial performance by one party.</i> Subsection (d) provides that standard contract terms may not be modified in a consumer contract that has been substantially performed by either party. This limitation addresses the concern that a modification may be initiated by the business once consum- ers are already locked into the transac- tion or relying on it, at which time the loss of acquired value from the modi- fication, or from terminating the rela- tionship, would be significant. What constitutes substantial performance varies with the subject matter and con- text of the contract. For example, in the case of a one-shot sale of a single good, substantial performance would consist of delivery of the good. In the case of a sale of goods to be delivered over time, substantial performance by the parties would consist of delivery of a portion of the goods such that the buyer received a substantial benefit from the contract. For contracts with unlimited duration, the modification may not apply to the portion already substantially per- formed, but the modification may apply to future obligations so long as it does not impose unreasonable cost, loss of value, or personal burden with respect to the portion already performed. The limitation in subsection (d) does not apply when the modification unambig- uously adds value to the consumer.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">20. A consumer receives a loan from a bank which is to be paid back in full within one year in 12 monthly payments. After the con- sumer receives the funds, the bank increases the charge for late month- ly payments and adds a free pre- payment option. The modification of the charge for late payments is unenforceable because the contract has been substantially performed by the bank. The addition of a free prepayment option is enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">21. A consumer opens a sav- ings account at a bank and adopts the standard contract terms. A year later, the bank modifies the data privacy terms in the contract. Be- cause the contract has unlimited duration and can be terminated by <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>either party at any time, it has not been substantially performed, and the modification may be enforce- able. If, however, the consumer can only avoid the new terms by closing the account, the availability of oth- er saving options would determine whether the modification has the ef- fect of undermining an affirmation or promise made by the bank that was made part of the basis of the original bargain, and thus whether it complies with subsection (c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Modification adopted using a more passive process.</i> It is not uncom- mon for the standard terms to be adopt- ed, initially, through one adoption pro- cess, such as requiring the consumer to click &#8220;I Agree&#8221; to the terms, and then modified through a different process that does not require a similar affir- mative action by the consumer. Terms modified in such a way can be adopted as part of the contract as long as the requirements of subsection (a) are met. There is concern, however, that when the initial terms are adopted through a specific, active process, the consum- er would expect the same or a similar process for modifications of the stan- dard terms. Similarly, if the business employed a particular process for prior modifications, the consumer would ex- pect the same or a similar process for future modifications. A shift to a more passive process triggers a heightened notice requirement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. Legal consequences of non-ad- opted terms.</i> A consumer has no obli- gation to assert that terms offered by the business as modifications were not adopted and may instead choose to get the benefit of the modified terms. If the consumer so chooses, the business may not assert that its modified contract terms were not adopted. (Cf. &#167; 2, Com- ment <i>12</i>.)</p>

A business posts a &#8220;New Privacy Policy&#8221; on its website with- out giving consumers a notice that the standard contract terms in this new policy purport to modify the existing contract. The New Privacy Policy is not adopted as a modifi- cation. As part of the New Priva- cy Policy, the business states that none of the consumers&#8217; personal information collected by the busi- ness will be shared with the govern- ment. A consumer may enforce the business&#8217;s statement as a binding contractual promise despite the fact that the New Privacy Policy is not adopted as an enforceable modifica- tion of the original contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>11. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and to the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts.</i> The rule of subsection (c), that modifications of standard terms are enforceable only if they are made in good faith, are fair and equitable, and do not undermine an affirmation or promise made by the business that has been made part of the basis of the bargain, is consistent with Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 89, and UCC &#167; 2&#8211;209 (see also Comment <i>7</i>). UCC &#167; 2&#8211;309 provides that a contract of indefinite duration is valid for a reasonable time and can be terminated on reasonable notice. The rule of subsection (d), that a contract substantially performed by one par- ty may not be modified retroactively, is consistent with Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 89, which pro- vides that a binding modification may be agreed upon &#8220;under a contract not fully performed on either side.&#8221;</p>

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. General.</i> This Section re- states several rules of interpretation and construction that have height- ened relevance to consumer contracts. The Section does not purport to cover all aspects of contract interpretation and construction. The Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, continues to provide guidance on the interpreta- tion and construction of consumer con- tracts, and its rules are not displaced by this Section. See &#167; 1, Comment 9.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Good faith and fair dealing.</i> The non-disclaimable duty of good faith and fair dealing is intended to capture and weed out various forms of opportu- nistic behavior&#8212;including unfair and inequitable advantage-taking, hold-up, manipulation, and dishonesty&#8212;that undermine the reasonable expectations of consumers, reduce the value of con- tracting, and require costly precautions. Good-faith performance or enforcement of a consumer contract emphasizes faithfulness to the agreed or reason- ably understood purpose and consis- tency with the justified expectations of the consumer. It excludes conduct that violates community standards of decen- cy, fairness, or reasonableness. See &#167; 1, Comment <i>7</i>; Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 205, Comment <i>a</i>; Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1&#8211;201(20).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Interpretation of terms against the business.</i> Because the business drafts the standard contract terms, the business has the opportunity to protect its own interests, to evaluate uncertainty of meaning, and to redraft the terms in a manner that reduces ambiguity. Thus, if the meaning of a term is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, and if other factors relevant to construct the mean- ing are not decisive, there is substan- tial reason for preferring a reasonable meaning that favors the consumer. See Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 206.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Interpretation of process state- ments, adoption directions, and notices against the business.</i> In scrutinizing the reasonableness of the process by which standard contract terms are adopted, the statements, adoption guidance, and notices provided by the business to inform consumers about the conse- quences of their actions are evaluated. See &#167;&#167; 2, 3. Like the interpretation of the substance of the standard contract terms, if such statements, directions, and notices are susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, an in- terpretation is preferred which favors the consumer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Reasonable expectations</i>. When a standard contract term is sus- ceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, the meaning that is consis- tent with the reasonable expectations of the consumers should be preferred, and consumers are not bound by any meaning that conflicts with such ex- pectations. This preference has partic- ularly strong justification when con- sumers&#8217; reasonable expectations were cultivated by the business&#8217;s precon- tractual promises or affirmation of fact, and in such circumstances a construction <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the contract that gives effect to consumers&#8217; reasonable expectations is preferred even when the conflicting standard contract term is unambig- uous. See &#167; 7(b)(1); &#167; 8, Comment <i>2</i>; &#167; 9. This rule protects expectations of consumers that the business has rea- son to anticipate would arise from the circumstances surrounding the busi- ness&#8217;s interaction with consumers, and that are central to consumers&#8217; decision to enter the transaction. See generally Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 211(3), Comment <i>f</i>, which pro- vides that standard contract terms that &#8220;eviscerate&#8221; the terms explicitly repre- sented to consumers, or that &#8220;eliminate the dominant purpose of the transac- tion,&#8221; are not enforceable.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 5. Discretionary Obligations</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A contract or any term that grants the business discretion to de- termine its rights and obligations must be interpreted, when reasonably susceptible to such interpretation, to provide that such discretion will be exercised reasonably and in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A term in a contract that purports to grant the business discre- tion to determine its contractual rights and obligations unconstrained by the good-faith obligation or by other implied limitation is unenforceable by the business.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. Discretionary terms.</i> A con- sumer contract may include provisions that grant the business discretion to specify or adjust its contractual ob- ligations. There are two types of dis- cretion-granting terms: (1) terms that grant the business discretion to resolve an issue that was left open in the ini- tial contract, e.g., when the initial con- tract states that any dispute will be settled by arbitration, does not spec- ify the arbitration forum, and grants the business discretion to choose the arbitration forum; and (2) terms that grant the business discretion to adjust or change obligations that were speci- fied in the initial contract, e.g., when the initial contract states that any dis- pute will be settled by arbitration in Arbitration Forum A and grants the business discretion to replace Arbitra- tion Forum A with another arbitration forum. This Section applies to both types of discretion-granting terms. Dis- cretion-granting terms of type (2) are modification clauses and thus governed also by &#167; 3 (see Comment <i>4</i>).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Discretionary terms restricted by good faith.</i> When a consumer con- tract includes a provision that grants the business discretion to specify or adjust its contractual obligations in a manner that overrides the implied duty to exercise the discretion reason- ably and in good faith, the contract lacks consideration because it fails the basic requirement of mutuality&#8212;that each party make a commitment to the other (Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 77). But, following a long tradition in contract law, subsection (a) establishes that such open-ended language does not ordinarily lead to nonenforcement if it can reasonably be read not to exclude the implied lim- itation that the business is required to exercise its discretion reasonably and in good faith. Such implied limitation is consistent with the approach taken by the Uniform Commercial Code (for example, in &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;305 and 2&#8211;306) and by the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts (&#167; 77, Comment <i>d</i>)&#8212;to sup- plement discretionary terms by an obli- gation to exercise the discretion in good faith. The implied duty of good faith <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>applies more broadly in shaping the performance obligation of both parties (see Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 205; UCC &#167; 1&#8211;304). It is emphasized here because of the central role that it plays in policing otherwise facially unlimited discretionary terms in consumer contracts and rendering contracts that contain them enforce- able. The implied duty of good faith cannot be waived. See generally UCC &#167; 1&#8211;302(b).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contract contains a clause requiring disputes between a business and a consumer to be resolved in a particular forum. It grants the business the power to set a forum and procedures at its own discretion and does not contain any express limitation on such discre- tion. The term is enforceable, but the business must exercise its dis- cretion in good faith, choosing a fo- rum and procedures that conform to commercial standards of fair deal- ing in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contract contains a clause applying to the entire agree- ment stating that the business &#8220;reserves the right at any time to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate, or change any or all terms of the contract, in whole or in part.&#8221; The clause is enforceable, but the busi- ness must exercise its powers under this clause in good faith. Any subse- quent modifications of the contract attempted under this clause would be enforceable if consistent with &#167; 3.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Discretionary terms in viola- tion of the good-faith restriction.</i> When a term in the contract purports to grant the business discretion to specify con- tractual obligations in a way that can- not be reconciled with or that explicitly conflicts with the duty to exercise such discretion reasonably and in good-faith, the business&#8217;s promises as expressed in those terms are often labeled by courts as &#8220;illusory&#8221; because by failing to con- strain its discretion the business made no meaningful commitment to the con- sumer with respect to the matters sub- ject to the discretionary rights. Such a term, or&#8212;if it is not severable (see &#167; 10(a))&#8212;the entire contract, is an illu- sory promise and is not enforceable by the business (but may be enforceable by the consumer; see Comment <i>8</i>). The term or contract may also be substan- tively unconscionable under &#167; 6.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer enters into an agreement for a cruise ser- vice with a business that operates cruise ships, pays a nonrefundable deposit to reserve a cabin on a spe- cific cruise, and agrees to pay the remainder of the price by a spec- ified date. The standard contract terms allow the business to cancel the reservation at any time and for any reason, without prior notice, and without providing any explana- tion or compensation. The contract is unenforceable by the business because the business&#8217;s promise is illusory. This conclusion does not change even if the business must return the deposit upon such termi- nation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer purchases a hot tub along with a two-year ser- vice agreement. The service compo- nent is priced separately but mar- keted as an important complement to the sale and as part of a single, unified transaction. The standard contract terms allow the business to cancel the service component at any time and for any reason by mailing back the remaining balance of the prepaid service price. The entire contract is unenforceable by the business, including the hot-tub sale, because a significant source of value can be eliminated by the busi- ness without any limitation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>4. Unilateral modification claus- es.</i> Businesses sometimes include, in their standard terms, a clause that purports to grant the business unre- stricted discretion to modify the terms of service. When reasonably suscep- tible of such an interpretation, such clauses should be interpreted to allow only good-faith modification, in accor- dance with this Section and &#167;&#167; 3 and 4. When the explicit language of the modification clause precludes such an interpretation, the clause is not con- sistent with subsection (a) and is thus unenforceable by the business under subsection (b). The clause may also be substantively unconscionable under &#167; 6. The effects of such an attempt to derogate from the good-faith restric- tion are described in &#167; 10.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contract between an airline and a consumer allows the airline to modify the frequent-flyer program at its discretion. The pro- vision is enforceable, and any sub- sequent modification is enforceable, if it is adopted in accordance with the requirements of &#167; 3, as long as it is done in good faith. A modifica- tion that unreasonably reduces the value of previously acquired perks is inconsistent with the good-faith requirement of this Section, and it may also violate the requirement of &#167; 3(a) if the airline does not afford the consumer a meaningful oppor- tunity to reject it. But a modifica- tion that reduces the value of pro- spectively acquired miles does not conflict with the good-faith require- ment.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Discretionary terms and course of performance.</i> A contract or a term that grants the business wide discre- tion is unenforceable by the business if the business has exhibited a pattern of conduct under which the discretion is exercised in the absence of good faith. Similarly, a modification clause that grants the business wide discretion to modify the terms of the contract is un- enforceable by the business if the busi- ness attempts to modify the contract with retroactive effect or otherwise in the absence of good faith. Those results apply even if, in the absence of such course of performance, the discretion or modification terms would be en- forceable under subsection (a) because it is subject to the implied obligation of good faith. In effect, the ability to invoke the implied obligation of good faith to save the term is negated when there is a course of performance that is inconsistent with a good-faith exercise of the business&#8217;s discretion, and in the absence of such an implied restriction the discretionary term is unenforceable by the business.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A contract contains an arbitration clause that allows the business to select the arbitration body and procedure at its discre- tion. Under subsection (a), the clause is enforceable, because the discretion is subject to an obligation to exercise it in good faith. Invoking this power, the business refers con- sumers&#8217; disputes to an arbitration body that is inaccessible to most consumers, despite the existence of more readily accessible and more reasonable alternatives. Such ex- ercise of discretion by the business violates the good-faith duty and is not enforceable. Depending on the circumstances, it may render the entire arbitration clause unenforce- able by the business. (See also &#167; 10.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. No requirement of symmetry.</i> Discretionary terms, by their nature, allocate contractual rights in an asym- metric manner. Such allocations are a regular feature of contracting and require no special justification. Thus, asymmetry alone does not make a contract unenforceable. As long as the discretionary power is bounded by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>requirement of good faith (and by other more specific contractual restrictions described in other sections of this Re- statement), it does not pose a problem of mutuality.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A consumer contract con- tains a choice-of-forum clause that requires all consumer complaints to be resolved in a specified forum but gives the business discretion to pursue its own complaints in a dif- ferent forum. The asymmetry alone does not render the clause unen- forceable by the business under this rule.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Guarantees of satisfaction and right to withdraw.</i> Consumer contracts may provide discretion to consumers, most commonly when consumers are accorded power to terminate or with- draw. Contracts may allocate such discretion by including terms like &#8220;sat- isfaction guaranteed&#8221; or &#8220;money-back guarantee.&#8221; When these guarantees are part of the terms of the contract (as opposed to try-before-you-buy solicita- tions), they may constitute conditions of satisfaction that consumers must ex- ercise in good faith. See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 228. They may also constitute promises by the business to grant consumers a right to withdraw from the contract and receive full refund. The exercise of the with- drawal rights by consumers must also be in accordance with the duty of good faith.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A consumer contract for the sale of a TV screen contains a standard term stating, &#8220;we guar- antee your satisfaction with the product. We will refund the price in full any time you are not satisfied.&#8221; A consumer purchased the screen, and while satisfied with the pic- ture quality and the technical per- formance, the consumer honestly claims not to be satisfied with the overall decorative appearance of the device when it is turned off. The satisfaction condition may be exer- cised by the consumer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Same facts as Illustration 8, but the consumer&#8217;s claim not to be satisfied is due to discovering that the same product is sold by another retailer for a lower price. Since the consumer is satisfied with the prod- uct, the consumer may not invoke the non-occurrence of the condition and is not entitled to a refund. If, however, the satisfaction condition includes language like &#8220;low price guarantee,&#8221; the consumer would be entitled to exercise it and receive a full refund.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Legal consequences of unen- forceable discretionary terms.</i> Terms that provide for the exercise of dis- cretion by the business without good faith are inconsistent with subsec- tion (a) and are unenforceable by the business under subsection (b). If such terms can be severed from the rest of the agreement, they are replaced with gap-fillers, as described in &#167; 10. If sev- erance or restriction of the terms can- not be accomplished by reformation or augmentation of the contract without undue burden (for example, when the unenforceable term is the price or the quantity), the entire contract is unen- forceable by the business. Discretion- ary terms in explicit violation of the good-faith restriction may also render the contract substantively unconscio- nable under &#167; 6. Discretionary terms intended to provide value to the con- sumer may be enforced by the consum- er, replacing the business&#8217;s discretion with gap-fillers, as described in &#167; 10.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. A contract for installation of a home-alarm system provides for one-year, on-site service at no additional charge in the event that the system malfunctions. The service <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>term in the contract grants the business unlimited discretion to schedule any requested service at its own convenience. It specifies that delayed scheduling of the re- pair would not give rise to any claim against the business. Such unlimit- ed discretion is not consistent with this Section. The consumer may enforce the on-site service promise stripped of the business&#8217;s unlimited scheduling discretion. The consum- er&#8217;s contractual right under the sev- ered agreement is to receive on-site service within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and to the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts.</i> The rule of this Section is consistent with Restate- ment of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 77, which treats discretionary terms as illusory when the discretion is not limited (by the doctrine of good faith or otherwise). It is also consistent with the approach of UCC &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;305, 2&#8211;306, 2&#8211;309, and 2&#8211;311(1), which impose good-faith limitations on discretion- ary terms. UCC &#167; 1&#8211;302(b) specifies that the duty of good faith may not be disclaimed by agreement but that the parties may agree on &#8220;the standards by which the performance of [the good- faith obligation] is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly un- reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 6. Unconscionability</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) An unconscionable contract or term is unenforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) In determining whether a contract or a term is unconscionable at the time the contract is made, a court examines the following factors:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) substantive unconscionability, namely a fundamentally unfair or unreasonably one-sided contract or term; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) procedural unconscionability, namely a contract or term that results in unfair surprise or results from the absence of meaningful choice on the part of the consumer.</p>
<p class="indent">In determining that a contract or a term is unconscionable, a greater degree of one of the factors in this subsection means that a lesser degree of the other factor is sufficient to establish unconscionability. In appro- priate circumstances, a sufficiently high degree of one of the factors is sufficient to establish unconscionability.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Without limiting the scope of subsection (b)(1), a contract term is substantively unconscionable if its effect is to:</p>

<p class="indent2">(B) any loss to the consumer caused by an intentional or negli- gent act or omission of the business;</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) unreasonably expand the consumer&#8217;s liability, the business&#8217;s remedies, or the business&#8217;s enforcement powers that would otherwise be applicable in the event of breach of contract by the consumer; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) unreasonably limit the consumer&#8217;s ability to pursue or express a complaint or seek reasonable redress for a violation of a legal right.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Without limiting the scope of subsection (b)(2), a contract term is procedurally unconscionable if a reasonable consumer in the circum- stances is not aware of the term or does not understand or appreciate the implications of the term, and as a result does not meaningfully account for the term in making the contracting decision. Factors relevant to mak- ing such a determination include:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) the legal and financial sophistication of a consumer who en- ters into such transactions;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the complexity of the term or of the agreement as a whole;</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) pressure tactics and manipulation employed by the business in soliciting the consumer&#8217;s assent; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) the process by which the term was introduced.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. The two prongs of unconscio- nability.</i> The doctrine of unconsciona- bility has the primary goal of protecting contracting parties against fundamen- tally unfair and unreasonably one-sid- ed terms. It thus represents one of the primary safeguards necessary in an environment in which complex terms are adopted without a realistic op- portunity for meaningful scrutiny by consumers. Because consumers rarely read or review the non-core standard contract terms, and because such faint- ly reviewed terms may nevertheless be adopted under the principles developed in the case law and reflected in &#167;&#167; 2 and 3 of this Restatement, the doctrine of unconscionability is a primary tool against the inclusion of intolerable terms in the consumer contract. Ac- cordingly, the adoption of a term under &#167;&#167; 2 or 3 does not prevent a finding of procedural or substantive unconsciona- bility under this Section. See Comment <i>6(a)</i>.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">While the principal element of the unconscionability doctrine is the sub- stantive prong that identifies such intolerable terms, the doctrine recog- nizes that sometimes consumers may choose to accept one-sided standard contract terms in exchange for anoth- er benefit (such as low price). The doc- trine asks whether consumers in fact meaningfully chose to accept a harsh term by also requiring, in most cases, a showing of some quantum of procedur- al unconscionability. In determining whether a contract or a term is uncon- scionable, a court has to examine its expected effects as they appear at the time that the contract was made (cf. Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 208, and Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) &#167; 2&#8211;302). Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 208, Com- ments <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, left to development by the courts whether a finding of uncon- scionability required a finding of both prongs or could be based on a finding of one prong alone. The majority of courts applying the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, consider the two prongs together and have adopted a requirement of finding both prongs. A significant minority of courts view the presence of either substantive <i>or</i> proce- dural unconscionability as a defense to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>enforcement, in particular as applied to standard contract terms. This Re- statement, by adopting a factors test, retains the flexibility, reflected in the case law, in the relation between sub- stantive unconscionability, procedural unconscionability, and a finding of un- enforceability.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Sliding scale.</i> When both the substantive and the procedural prongs are necessary for a finding of uncon- scionability, they need not be present in the same degree. Under subsection (b), the two prongs are viewed in tan- dem, and a sliding-scale approach is applied: a large quantum of one prong means that a smaller quantum of the other is sufficient to establish uncon- scionability. Taken to its logical ex- treme, the sliding-scale approach can accommodate the view of a significant minority of courts that the presence of either substantive <i>or</i> procedural un- conscionability suffices as a defense to enforcement. Because the ultimate goal of the unconscionability doctrine is to deny enforcement to contract terms that are fundamentally unfair, a high degree of substantive unconscio- nability could be sufficient to find that a standard contract term, ordinarily not one of the core-deal terms of which most consumers are aware, is uncon- scionable. Conversely, a high degree of procedural unconscionability could be sufficient to find that a one-sided stan- dard contract term with a lesser degree of fundamental unfairness is uncon- scionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Substantive unconscionabil- ity.</i> The substantive-unconscionabili- ty test in subsection (b)(1) addresses the unfairness and one-sidedness of a contract term that potentially under- mines the consumer&#8217;s benefit from the bargain, and for which the business cannot show a reasonable justification. There are various ways to characterize the required severity of the substan- tive unconscionability&#8212;e.g., &#8220;shock the conscience,&#8221; &#8220;oppressive,&#8221; &#8220;unreason- ably harsh,&#8221; or &#8220;fundamentally unfair.&#8221; Those tests, as articulated by courts and in the Uniform Commercial Code, are all intended to capture a limiting criterion: that the doctrine is to be used only when the one-sidedness of a term in the contract is extreme.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In general, it is impossible to eval- uate the one-sidedness of a particu- lar term at the time the contract is made without looking at the contract as a whole, including the price. What might appear as unfair may be mere- ly a bargain-basement deal in which the pro-business term is matched by a pro-consumer price or other consumer advantage. And what might otherwise appear fair may undermine a specific benefit of the bargain the consumer was led to expect. Thus, for example, a contract that provides few rights to a consumer may not be problematic if a low price reflects those minimal rights, but might be problematic with- out the corresponding benefit of a low price. Likewise, an extreme pro-busi- ness term may not be unfair if, in the context surrounding the contract, it reflects or offsets a large risk taken by the business; and conversely, an ordi- nary limitation on use may in the con- text be unfair if it undermines a cen- tral benefit the consumer reasonably expects from the transaction. While the presence of a competitive market environment may suggest that, in or- dinary commerce, pro-business terms would lead to more favorable prices or other terms for consumers, it does not preclude a legal finding that a term is substantively unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Contract terms that are sub- stantively unconscionable.</i> Subsection (c) provides a non-exhaustive list of categories of standard contract terms that are substantively unconscionable, if their effect is to impose:</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(a). Unreasonable limit on the business&#8217;s liability or the consumer&#8217;s remedies.</i> Subsection (c)(1) establishes <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>that it is unconscionable to unreason- ably exclude or limit the business&#8217;s li- ability or the consumer&#8217;s remedies that would otherwise be applicable for (A) death or personal injury for which, in the absence of a contractual provision in the consumer contract, the business would be liable, or (B) any loss to the consumer caused by an intentional or negligent act or omission of the busi- ness. Subsection (c)(1) applies both to limits on the consumer&#8217;s remedies and to limits on the business&#8217;s liability, in- cluding disclaimers of implied warran- ties. Standard contract terms stating that the liability or remedy limitations are specifically agreed upon, or that conduct that would otherwise be re- garded by law as negligent is contrac- tually agreed upon to be non-negligent, do not necessarily render the limit on liability reasonable. A limit on liability for personal injury may be reasonable, for example, in situations in which the consumer is well positioned to pre- vent the loss or in which the activity is broadly known to involve significant physical risks. But even then, the waiv- er may not apply if the business failed to take cost-effective measures to re- duce the risk.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A consumer purchases fit- ness equipment for her household use. The contract contains standard terms that release the seller from li- ability for all risk of personal injury arising from the use of the equip- ment, including injuries arising from defects in the equipment that would otherwise constitute breach of warranty. This limitation of con- sequential damages is substantive- ly unconscionable. See also UCC &#167; 2&#8211;719(3), which states that this limitation is prima facie substan- tively unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A consumer enters an agreement with a fitness club that uses the same equipment as in Il- lustration 1. The agreement con- tains standard contract terms re- leasing the club from liability for all risks of personal injury, includ- ing injuries arising from defective or poorly maintained equipment. While this service contract does not come under UCC &#167; 2&#8211;719(3), the same principle of unconscionabili- ty applies under this Restatement. The release from liability is sub- stantively unconscionable if, in the absence of such standard contract terms, the business would be liable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer purchases a lift ticket at a ski resort and, in the circumstances, adopts the terms stated on the ticket. The ticket re- cites standard contract terms that disclaim the resort&#8217;s liability for personal injuries to the consumer while the consumer is using the skiing facilities. The disclaimer is not substantively unconscionable because skiing is an activity broad- ly known to involve significant risk of death or personal injury, and the disclaimer is thus not unreasonable. Nevertheless, the application of the disclaimer to risks caused not by an inherent risk of skiing but directly by the resort&#8217;s negligence&#8212;such as negligently allowing fallen logs to remain on the ski runs or failing to prevent malfunctions of the ski lifts&#8212;is substantively unconsciona- ble under subsection (c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(b). Unreasonable expansion of the consumer&#8217;s liability, the business&#8217;s remedies, or the business&#8217;s enforcement powers.</i> Subsection (c)(2) establishes that consumers&#8217; liability for breach may not unreasonably exceed the lia- bility that would otherwise apply, and that consumers may not be subject to enforcement measures that unreason- ably expand the enforcement measures that would otherwise apply. What is reasonable depends on the lost profit incurred by the business, the difficul- ty of obtaining redress, and the value <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the unpaid-for benefits the con- sumer enjoyed before breach. Under long-standing case law and statutes in many jurisdictions, excessive liqui- dated damages and early-termination fees are not enforceable, even if they do not rise to the level of substantive unconscionability. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 356; UCC &#167; 2&#8211;718(1).) Other instances in which expansion of a business&#8217;s rem- edies and enforcement tactics may be substantively unconscionable include, but are not limited to, cross-collateral clauses, waiver-of-defense clauses, and debt-collection clauses. They are un- conscionable under consumer-contract law even if, at the same time, they may also be unenforceable under other legal rules. A finding of substantive uncon- scionability can be avoided by showing that the remedial provision is reason- able, for example, when the consumer received some front-end value in ex- change for the expanded remedies.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">4. A cellphone-service provid- er enters into a two-year contract with a consumer. The consumer does <i>not</i> receive any meaningful, up-front benefit, like a subsidized device or a lower-than-market rate for the service. The contract stipu- lates that a consumer who exits the relationship before the end of the two-year commitment period must pay a fee of $250, regardless of the timing of exit. The termination fee satisfies the substantive-uncon- scionability test. It may also be an unenforceable penalty for breach (see Restatement of the Law Sec- ond, Contracts &#167; 356). If, however, the consumer receives meaningful, up-front benefits for agreeing to the two-year commitment, the termina- tion fee may not be unreasonable and therefore not substantively un- conscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A car dealership enters into a three-year lease contract with a consumer. The contract contains an early termination clause that stipulates a liquidated damages formula. The consumer terminates the lease prior to its scheduled end. Under the termination clause, the consumer is charged a sum that is greater than the remaining pay- ments under the lease contract plus the excess wear and depreciation relative to the level permitted un- der the contract. As applied to this scenario, the liquidated damages formula is substantively unconscio- nable. See also UCC &#167;&#167; 2A&#8211;504 and 2A&#8211;528(1).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. An online news source en- ters into a three-year subscription with a consumer. The contract stip- ulates that a consumer who termi- nates the subscription prematurely must pay damages that exceed the sum of remaining payments un- der the subscription. The liquidat- ed-damages clause is substantively unconscionable because it expands above the business&#8217;s lost profit the consumer&#8217;s liability that would oth- erwise apply.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(c). Unreasonable limit on con- sumer&#8217;s ability to enforce a legal right.</i> Subsection (c)(3) establishes that it is substantively unconscionable to speci- fy an excessively burdensome redress mechanism and, by doing so, to un- reasonably limit consumers&#8217; ability to enforce their legal rights. Such limita- tions are unconscionable because they undermine the substantive rights con- sumers acquired under the contract. They are substantively unconscionable for the same reason that limitations on remedies are&#8212;that it is the essence of a contract that at least minimum ade- quate recovery for breach be available (UCC &#167; 2&#8211;719, Official Comment 1). A business may try to limit consum- ers&#8217; reasonable redress through un- reasonable choice-of-forum clauses, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>choice-of-law clauses, or arbitration arrangements that in each case impose unreasonably high costs on consumers or provide some other unfair advan- tage to the business; waivers of aggre- gate-litigation processes in situations in which individual suits are imprac- tical; unreasonably short limitations periods; unjustified denial of statutory damages and attorneys&#8217; fees; and more. While consumers may agree to limit their process rights, the agreed-up- on arrangements must enable some reasonably effective pursuit of legally available redress for breach of contract or for violation of legal rights that gov- ern the contractual relationship. A lim- it on the consumer&#8217;s ability to enforce a legal right may not be substantively unconscionable if it is not too severe, if it serves to screen meritless claims, or when the consumer received some val- ue in return for it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (c)(3) states a principle of consumer-contract law and does not express a preference for a particular mode of dispute resolution, such as lit- igation, arbitration, or mediation. The requirement that a consumer&#8217;s right to seek redress not be unreasonably hindered may be further strengthened or weakened by other laws and regula- tions governing the choice of law and forum. For example, it may be bol- stered by the doctrine of &#8220;effective vin- dication&#8221; in arbitration law or by laws that prohibit pre-dispute arbitration agreements in specific sectors. And, conversely, the requirement in subsec- tion (c)(3) may be weakened by federal law&#8217;s preference for some forms of dis- pute resolution, even if those erode the right to seek redress. In stating a prin- ciple of consumer-contract law, subsec- tion (c)(3) does not address the possible interaction of such a contract-law prin- ciple with federal law, and specifically, it does not address its possible preemp- tion under the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A business&#8217;s standard con- tract terms include a dispute-reso- lution term specifying a forum in a distant location, such that the con- sumer would have to bear travel and accommodation expenses exceeding the value of the remedy sought. The dispute-resolution forum requires a non-refundable filing fee exceed- ing the value of the remedy sought. Either one of these two features unreasonably limits the consum- er&#8217;s ability to enforce legal rights and renders the dispute-resolution clause substantively unconsciona- ble. That result applies to any type of dispute-resolution forum that im- poses such an unreasonable cost or personal burden, be it a public court or a private arbitration tribunal.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A business&#8217;s standard con- tract terms include a class-action waiver and do not specify a choice of forum, thus allowing consumers to resolve disputes in court. A com- mon grievance for consumers enter- ing this contract involves low dam- ages&#8212;no more than a few dollars each. A court may determine that the class-action waiver is substan- tively unconscionable because it un- reasonably limits consumers&#8217; abili- ty to obtain a remedy for breach.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Same facts as Illustration 8, but the contract also contains a choice of forum clause requir- ing consumers to resolve disputes through arbitration. If the costs of pursuing individual arbitration make it impractical for consumers to seek redress for breach of the contract, a court may determine that the provision in the contract barring class actions is substantive- ly unconscionable. In such case, the arbitration clause is enforceable if the arbitration forum permits class arbitration, but substantively un- conscionable otherwise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>10. Same facts as Illustration 9, but the contract further specifies that consumers may pursue the individual arbitration proceedings online without incurring any filing cost, and, if their claim prevails, the consumers will be entitled, in ad- dition to the remedies in law, to a bonus of a significant sum of money, more than enough to compensate most consumers for the time and ef- fort necessary to engage in the arbi- tration proceeding. The class-action waiver is not substantively uncon- scionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. A business&#8217;s standard con- tract terms require that all claims against the business be made with- in three months after the conclu- sion of the transaction. The clause is substantively unconscionable to the extent that it covers claims aris- ing from latent defects. (Cf. UCC &#167; 2&#8211;725(1).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(d). Limits on consumers&#8217; ability to pursue or express a complaint.</i> In the same spirit, it is substantively uncon- scionable for the business to unrea- sonably limit the consumer&#8217;s ability to express or pursue a complaint, or to re- strict the ability of the consumer to en- gage in review, assessment, or analysis of the business&#8217;s performance. (Cf. Con- sumer Review Fairness Act of 2016, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45b.)</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">12. A business includes in its standard-form contract a clause that charges a high monetary pen- alty every time a consumer posts a negative review of the business online or obligates the consumer to indemnify the business for any loss caused by the negative review. This &#8220;anti-disparagement&#8221; clause is sub- stantively unconscionable, because it unreasonably limits the consum- er&#8217;s ability to pursue or express a complaint about the product.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Substantive unconscionability versus statutory standards.</i> The sub- stantive-unconscionability standard may capture contract terms that are also considered &#8220;unfair acts or practic- es&#8221; under the Federal Trade Commis- sion (FTC) Act and state Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) statutes. The extensive jurisprudence identifying such unfair acts and prac- tices ought to continue to inform courts in evaluating unfair standard contract terms under the unconscionability doctrine. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Pro- tection Act prohibits &#8220;abusive acts or practices&#8221; (12 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5531, 5536(a)). Practices defined by regulatory and en- forcement agencies as unfair or abusive may also be substantively unconscio- nable when authorized in the standard contract terms. However, a finding of substantive unconscionability may re- quire a degree of fundamental unfair- ness (or abusiveness) that is different than the level of unfairness (or abu- siveness) that supports some claims under those consumer-protection stat- utes. Compliance with statutory stan- dards would be relevant in considering whether a term is substantively uncon- scionable but, in proper circumstances, would not bar a finding of substantive unconscionability.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. Procedural unconscionability.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(a). Non-core standard contract terms.</i> The procedural prong of the unconscionability doctrine refers to some defects in the bargaining <i>process</i>. Compliance with the adoption process described in &#167; 2 does not eliminate the possibility of unfair surprise and lack of meaningful choice, and therefore it does not eliminate the potential for procedural unconscionability, because consumers are not likely to review the non-core standard contract terms and appreciate their effect (see &#167; 1, Com- ment <i>5</i>). Indeed, as explained in Com- ment <i>6(d)</i>, non-core standard contract terms are viewed by many courts as presumptively procedurally unconscio- nable. And yet a finding of procedural unconscionability based solely on the fact that a term was not a core deal term and was presented in standard, non-negotiable form, without more, constitutes the lowest quantum of pro- cedural unconscionability and would have to be matched with a high degree of substantive unconscionability to ren- der the contract or term unenforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(b). Unfair surprise.</i> The element of &#8220;unfair surprise&#8221; is central to a find- ing of procedural unconscionability. It refers to terms that, in the context of the bargain as presented to consum- ers, are not reasonably expected by consumers. The conflict with the con- sumer&#8217;s reasonable expectations can be demonstrated by the effect of the term in undermining a dominant purpose of the transaction or its value. It can also be demonstrated by the manner in which the effect of the term was hidden or otherwise suppressed, causing con- sumers to reasonably assume that the contract does not have that effect. (See also &#167; 7(b).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(c). Consumer awareness; market context.</i> The procedural-unconscio- nability test may look to consumer awareness of the term in a market con- text. The question would be whether ordinary consumers would be aware of the term or would expect its inclu- sion&#8212;understanding and appreciating its implications&#8212;and thus would be more likely to meaningfully account for it when making contracting deci- sions. When consumers expect or are aware of a term and understand and appreciate its implications, the term can (though it may not always) affect their contracting decisions. In those situations, the reasons for intervention in the substance of the deal are dimin- ished. One question, then, in applying the procedural unconscionability test is whether a term is likely to affect the contracting decisions of a large enough number of consumers. (If the market is segmented, the question is whether a term is likely to affect the contracting decisions of a large enough number of consumers in the relevant segment.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A term that is demonstrated to af- fect the contracting decisions of a sub- stantial number of consumers is more likely to be subject to forces of market competition, even if it is not negotiat- ed and even if it appears in the con- tracts of all businesses in the relevant market. Such a term may be policed by market forces, and so policing by courts&#8212;through the unconscionabil- ity doctrine&#8212;may be less necessary and may lead to undesirable results, including a reduction in consumer choice. On the other hand, when drafting <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>terms that do not affect consumers&#8217; contracting decisions, the business is not subject to market discipline, and so the unconscionability doctrine is all the more necessary to police such terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The prevalence, in the relevant market, of similar pro-business terms does not negate a finding of procedur- al unconscionability. Indeed, if a term does not affect consumers&#8217; contract- ing decisions, all businesses might be tempted to draft a similar term in a one-sided, pro-business fashion.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(d). Terms that affect the contract- ing decisions.</i> Ordinarily, non-core standard contract terms do not affect the contracting decisions of a substan- tial number of consumers. This obser- vation applies most forcefully when the standard contract term is part of a long list of fine-print terms. Non-core standard contract terms do not affect the contracting decisions of consum- ers even if they are presented in larger font or positioned in a prominent place in the form contract, because it is ex- ceedingly uncommon for consumers to be aware even of such bolstered disclo- sure or to appreciate the effect of these terms. Accordingly, non-core standard terms are presumptively procedurally unconscionable. In contrast, when the standard contract term is part of the core deal terms, e.g., a bottom-line price or delivery fee, it ordinarily affects the contracting decisions of consumers. Moreover, some non-core standard con- tract terms may affect the contracting decisions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In determining whether a standard contract term affects the contracting decisions of a substantial number of consumers, courts ought to look at factors like consumers&#8217; limited sophis- tication, the business&#8217;s use of incom- prehensible language in the standard contract terms, the business&#8217;s use of high-pressure sales tactics, the busi- ness&#8217;s use of manipulative techniques in prioritizing or hiding information, and the existence of external circum- stances (not created by the business) that compelled consumers to execute the contract. In addition, in situations of extreme inequality in bargaining power between the business and the consumer, when consumers are com- pelled to transact with the business re- gardless of the standard contract term, the term is unlikely to affect the con- tracting decisions of many consumers. Of course, a business may demonstrate that a term does affect consumers&#8217; con- tracting decisions with appropriate evidentiary support, for example, by survey evidence (as commonly used in litigation involving aspects of unfair competition) or by any other indicia suggesting that the term was effective- ly communicated in the course of the pre-contractual representations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(e). Manipulation.</i> A term in a consumer contract may at times be presented in a manner intended to and having the effect of reducing consum- ers&#8217; awareness of its inclusion or of its implications, thus making it unneces- sarily difficult or, as a practical mat- ter, impossible for consumers to make a choice regarding the inclusion of the term. Tactics that unreasonably re- duce consumers&#8217; deliberative capacity, that make it unnecessarily harder for consumers to learn information about the product, or that unreasonably bur- den the ability of consumers to decline unwanted elements of the transaction deny consumers a meaningful choice. Such manipulative tactics constitute a high quantum of procedural uncon- scionability, and even a lesser degree of substantive unconscionability would render the term unenforceable. They may also be policed under &#167; 7 (Decep- tion).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">16. A fitness center advertis- es two membership plans: Plan 1 charges a lower membership fee but requires a two-year commitment <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and imposes an early-termination fee; Plan 2, titled &#8220;No Contract,&#8221; charges a higher membership fee but allows consumers to terminate with no penalty anytime. The ze- ro-termination-fee feature is made explicit in the marketing of the &#8220;No Contract&#8221; plan. By virtue of the explicit advertising, the possi- bility and cost of early termination become known to consumers. Con- sumers can reasonably weigh the value of the choice. Accordingly, the termination penalty in Plan 1 is not procedurally unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. A sales contract includes a non-possessory security-interest clause, like the substantively un- conscionable one presented in Illus- tration 13. The clause is part of a long &#8220;boilerplate&#8221; form presented to the consumer during the closing of the transaction, which the consum- er must sign to complete the trans- action. In circumstances in which consumers have limited financial sophistication, the clause is proce- durally unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">18. A payday lender offers short-term loans with two repay- ment options. The first, a &#8220;renewal&#8221; path, automatically occurs unless the consumer affirmatively selects and communicates the second, &#8220;decline to renew&#8221; option. The au- tomatic renewal comes with addi- tional finance charges of more than 30 percent of the loan. Information about the automatic renewal, the associated renewal costs, and how to carry out the process of switch- ing to non-renewal appears amidst densely packed text, without any additional notice, and in a manner less prominent than the core terms of the loan. This text also instructs consumers that in order to choose the &#8220;decline to renew&#8221; option, the consumer has to request that a link be sent by email and then navigate through an online portal and make several choices, none of which is clearly labeled as relating to non-re- newal, including the option to click &#8220;change the scheduled payment.&#8221; Such an interface makes a choice by the consumer of non-renewal un- necessarily difficult to execute and is procedurally unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">19. A weight-loss service al- lows consumers to enter a seven day &#8220;trial&#8221; of their online services for $10, which it prominently ad- vertises on its website. To start the trial period, the consumer is invited to answer personal questions and is required to provide payment infor- mation. At the bottom of the page appears a large button &#8220;Start My Trial Now.&#8221; Above it a conspicu- ous legend states, &#8220;You will only be charged $10 for your 7-day trial.&#8221; Below that button, in small, un-hy- perlinked, inconspicuous print ap- pears a sentence stating that by failing to cancel the services be- fore the end of the seven-day trial period, the consumer will be auto- matically enrolled in a $350 yearly subscription. The website does not provide instructions how to avoid the automatic renewal. Such an in- terface makes it unnecessarily diffi- cult for consumers who are lured by the &#8220;trial&#8221; offer, but prefer to avoid the costly annual subscription, to make their preferred choice. It is procedurally unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">20. The booking site of a va- cation resort leads the consumer through a series of web pages, where the consumer can select the room type, the number of occupants, and the check-in and check-out dates. Prior to completing the reservation, the website takes the consumer to a new web page, where add-on valet parking services are presented and automatically added to the trans- action, via a pre-clicked button, for an extra fee of $500. To remove the add-on, the consumer must find and <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>click on the option &#8220;No, Thanks&#8221; which appears in small font at an inconspicuous place on the web page, then navigate a series of ad- ditional pages to complete the re- jection of the add-on service. The design of the website significantly hinders the consumer&#8217;s ability to decline the valet parking service; it is manipulative, and the contract term that adds the service is proce- durally unconscionable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Procedural unconscionabili- ty&#8212;related concepts.</i></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(a). Subjective knowledge.</i> Sub- jective knowledge of an individual consumer does not preclude a finding of procedural unconscionability if the finding of procedural unconscionabili- ty is based on the objective test of con- sumer awareness. Subjective knowl- edge does not cure the market failure caused when a term does not affect the contracting decisions of a substantial number of consumers.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(b). Disclosure.</i> The procedur- al-unconscionability inquiry should be distinguished from the standards of mandated disclosure. It is not enough that the harsh terms were disclosed in larger typeface or other conspicuous manner, that notices were furnished to alert consumers to the presence of the terms, or that a ritual of a separate af- firmation of assent to the harsh terms was mechanically followed. While such enhanced presentation may satisfy other rules mandating disclosure (e.g., Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2301), may satisfy the require- ments of adoption under &#167; 2 of the Re- statement, and may be one of the fac- tors in determining whether there was a &#8220;surprising and unexpected term,&#8221; it does not establish a safe harbor against a finding of procedural unconscionabil- ity. Because of the length, complexity, and accumulation of standard-contract terms, within each contract and across the many transactions consumers reg- ularly enter, an enhanced-format dis- closure of terms does not guarantee that consumers will notice them, un- derstand their effect, and update their contractual expectations. Accordingly, enhanced disclosure does not create a presumption that consumers ought to have noticed the terms and does not guarantee the absence of unfair sur- prise or the presence of meaningful choice. The harsh effect of the standard terms can continue to be hidden even in full daylight, given that consumers rarely read those terms and, even if they do, often may not understand or appreciate their effect at the time of contracting. In particular, the display of standard contract terms in ALL CAPS or other enhanced typeface does not, in and of itself, avoid procedural unconscionability. The Uniform Com- mercial Code provides guidance in this area. While a disclaimer may be con- spicuous under UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316(2) by vir- tue of, among other factors, the type- face used to display it (UCC &#167; 1&#8211;201(b) (10)), it may still be ineffective and procedurally unconscionable, because reasonable consumers against whom it is to operate would not have noticed it. While the UCC stipulates that a conspicuous disclaimer of warranties is effective, it also explains that the underlying purpose is to &#8220;protect the buyer from surprise,&#8221; namely to deny enforcement to &#8220;unexpected and unbar- gained language&#8221; (UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316(2) and Official Comment 1). If the disclosure is not effective in protecting the consum- er from surprise and the disclosed term is not likely to affect the contracting de- cisions of a substantial number of con- sumers entering such a transaction, it does not preclude a finding of procedur- al unconscionability.</p>

The standard terms, which were presented at the time of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>purchase and adopted under &#167; 2, include a disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability that satisfies the requirements of UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316 and of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. If a court finds that the disclaimer is substantively un- conscionable, the court may also find that the disclaimer was proce- durally unconscionable on grounds that it was &#8220;surprising and unex- pected&#8221; and refuse to enforce it, even if the disclaimer was printed in conspicuous font.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Unconscionable price.</i> The sub- stantive unconscionability test can be applied to scrutinize the contract price, but this should be done with extra care. An excessively high price, substantial- ly in excess of the price at which simi- lar products are obtainable in similar consumer transactions by like consum- ers, or bearing no reasonable relation- ship to the cost of providing the good or service, may be found to be substan- tively unconscionable. The procedur- al-unconscionability test may be more difficult to satisfy because the price is usually the most prominent element of a transaction and a critical factor in the consumer&#8217;s contracting decision (see Comment <i>6</i>). Still, an egregiously high price may be held unconscionable by courts if it occurs in connection with unfair surprise or the absence of mean- ingful choice. A price term itself may surprise consumers, for example, when a product is sold via a complex pricing scheme. A consumer may be unfairly surprised when the price is multidi- mensional and certain price dimen- sions do not affect the contracting deci- sions. A consumer may also be unfairly surprised when the price is contingent or deferred and the consumer under- estimates the likelihood of triggering the relevant price or the importance of certain deferred price dimensions (e.g., a long-term interest rate that replaces a low teaser rate after the introductory period, or the long-term, overall price of a repeatedly rolled-over, short-term loan), and thus underestimates the true cost of the contract. An egregious- ly high price may also result from ab- sence of meaningful choice when there are market imperfections that make it less likely that the price was set by a freely competitive market to reflect the cost or the fair value of the product. And it may arise in situations in which the consumer&#8217;s levels of literacy and numeracy or urgency of needs impede the exercise of the sophisticated, pru- dent judgment needed to evaluate the price. In those circumstances, a court might find that the price term is pro- cedurally unconscionable. When the price, or some element of the price, is hidden from consumers, it may also be policed under &#167; 7 (Deception).</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">22. A consumer contracts for a two-year home security plan, when a one-year plan with much lower monthly payments is available to the consumer from the same busi- ness. The business does not advise the consumer of the availability of the one-year plan. It is substantive- ly unconscionable to contract for the two-year plan, which provides no benefit to the consumer relative to the cheaper one-year plan. It is pro- cedurally unconscionable to with- hold information about the clearly superior (from the consumer&#8217;s per- spective) one-year plan.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">23. A business promises to help a consumer obtain a $14,000 unclaimed surplus from the sale of the consumer&#8217;s foreclosed-on prop- erty in exchange for half the sur- plus, i.e., for a $7,000 fee. In the cir- cumstances, the consumer is aware that the surplus is obtainable, but does not know that it could be easily obtained by visiting the court&#8217;s help desk (which is easy to find and use) without paying any fee. The $7,000 fee is substantively unconscionable. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>The procedural-unconscionability test is also satisfied, because the availability of the court&#8217;s help desk was withheld from the consumer and in dealing with such a business and accepting such advice the con- sumer would not have known that the surplus could be obtained easily and without cost at the court&#8217;s help desk. The outcome would be differ- ent if the business had to expend substantial resources in identifying consumers with such unclaimed surpluses&#8212;consumers who, with- out this contract, would have re- ceived nothing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">24. A set of cookware is sold, by home solicitation, for $375 in an area where a set of comparable quality is readily available for $125 or less. The high price satisfies the substantive-unconscionability test. The procedural-unconscionability test is satisfied if a high-pressure, door-to-door sales method prevent- ed the consumer from obtaining in- formation on the prevailing market price.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">25. A consumer borrows $5,000 under a three-year unsecured loan contract carrying an interest rate of 135 percent. The interest rate (the &#8220;price&#8221; of the loan) is substantively unconscionable if, under the facts of the case, it is excessive relative to the cost of credit the consumer can obtain on a comparable loan else- where, or relative to the expected cost for the business of supplying the credit, taking into account the risk of default. The procedural-un- conscionability test is satisfied if the interest-rate term was obscured at the time of entering the contract, or if the consumer was under pres- sure to enter the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Noncommercial activity.</i> The rule of this Section does not draw a distinction between commercial and noncommercial activity. Some courts, for example, have held that the rule of subsection (c)(1) does not apply when the business that supplies the stan- dard contract terms is operating not for profit or applies those terms only to its noncommercial activity. The black letter rejects this approach. However, the noncommercial nature of the trans- action or the presence of a not-for-profit participant may be taken into account by a court in determining whether a contract or a term satisfies the defini- tion of &#8220;unconscionable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. Effects of unconscionability.</i> Under subsection (a), an unconsciona- ble contract or term is unenforceable to the extent stated in &#167; 10. In particular, &#167; 10 restates the power of a court to choose between not enforcing the un- conscionable term or contract at all or merely limiting the application of any unconscionable clause so as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>11. Illegality.</i> The doctrine of un- conscionability is related to but distinct from the doctrine of illegality or unen- forceability on grounds of public policy. A contract or a term is unenforceable if its performance is inconsistent with statutory or regulatory law or with public policy. See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 178. The legal implications of unenforceability are re- stated in &#167; 10 of this Restatement.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>12. Shield versus sword.</i> An un- conscionability claim can be used as a defense (&#8220;shield&#8221;). For example, if a business sues to collect money charged to, but unpaid by, the consumer, the consumer can defend by showing that the charge is unconscionable. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>same unconscionability claim can be made by the consumer as a plaintiff if, for example, an unconscionable charge was already collected by the business and the consumer is suing to recov- er it. In that procedural posture, it is sometimes said that the unconsciona- bility claim is used as a &#8220;sword.&#8221; That description is misleading. The uncon- scionability claim is used to challenge the business&#8217;s exercise of an alleged contractual right, as in the traditional &#8220;shield&#8221; cases. A true &#8220;sword&#8221; applica- tion would arise if the consumer had a cause of action for the mere inclusion of an unconscionable term in the con- tract. Some state consumer-protection laws create an unconscionability-based affirmative right of action and allow consumers to sue for statutory damag- es. Such statutory claims fall outside the scope of this Restatement. See &#167; 7, Comment <i>7</i>; &#167; 10, Comment <i>1</i>.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>13. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and to the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts.</i> The rules restated herein are consistent with Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 208, and UCC &#167; 2&#8211;302, as ap- plied by courts. The unconscionability doctrine has long been understood as being comprised of a procedural prong and a substantive prong. Even in sales- of-goods transactions, warranty dis- claimers and limitations of remedies are tested not only against the specific rules of UCC &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;316(2) and 2&#8211;719(3) but also against the general, overar- ching unconscionability norm of UCC &#167; 2&#8211;302. Such scrutiny may add addi- tional circumstances under which pro- visions may be found unconscionable beyond those stipulated in the specific rules.</p>
<p class="indent">(a) A contract or a term adopted as a result of a deceptive act or prac- tice by the business is unenforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Without limiting the scope of subsection (a), an act or practice by the business is deceptive if it has the effect of:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) contradicting or unreasonably limiting in the standard con- tract terms a material affirmation of fact or promise made by the busi- ness before the consumer assented to the transaction;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) obscuring the presentation of a material term of the contract or of its effect, including a charge to be paid by the consumer or the overall cost or detriment to the consumer; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) obscuring the fact that the subject matter of the contract does not have a material beneficial attribute that consumers to such trans- actions reasonably expect it to have.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. Deception renders a contract or term unenforceable</i>. This Section provides the consumer with the power to avoid any contract or term that is a result of a deceptive act or practice by the business. Deception undermines the premise that the contract term was agreed to and that it promotes the in- terests of all contracting parties. De- ception under this Section does not re- quire an intent to deceive. This Section elaborates on the rules in the Restate- ment of the Law Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 159 to 173, to render unenforceable standard contract terms that conflict with material affirmations of fact or promises that preceded the manifestation <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of assent, even though the affirma- tions of fact or promises that led to this conflict may not be made or undertak- en with an intent to deceive. Deception is evaluated in context, taking into ac- count the consumer&#8217;s perspective, and the relevant inquiry is how the act or practice alleged to be deceptive typical- ly affects a consumer who is the target of such an act or practice. Cf. Restate- ment of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 164 (contract voidable as a result of a misrepresentation that is either fraud- ulent <i>or</i> material). The consumer may avoid the specific term, or, if the effect of the term is to undermine the value of the contract as a whole, the entire contract. Additional effects of severing a term from the contract, including the possible reformation of the contract, are addressed in &#167; 10.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Specific forms of deception.</i> Subsection (b) lists examples of acts or practices that are prima facie decep- tive. These examples share a pattern in which the business draws the consum- er in by cultivating the consumer&#8217;s rea- sonable expectations that the subject matter of the contract will have some attributes, which the business then attempts to deny or qualify in a less noticeable manner. Such conduct by the business could be a form of misrep- resentation, when the business knows that the standard contract terms are not aligned with other affirmation of facts and promises. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 161, Comment <i>e</i>.) It also interferes with the reasonable expectations the busi- ness elicited among consumers. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 211(3), Comment <i>f</i>.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b)(1) establishes that it is deceptive to make a material affir- mation of fact or promise that is con- tradicted by or unreasonably limited in the standard contract terms. (See &#167; 1(a)(6) for the definition of &#8220;affirma- tion of fact or promise.&#8221;) For example, it is deceptive to represent that a ser- vice is covered by an extensive warran- ty when the standard contract terms include broad disclaimers of implied warranties and other limitations on the business&#8217;s liability. (See &#167; 7(c).) In the same spirit, a clause in the standard contract terms claiming precedence over contract terms individually and expressly negotiated is not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A consumer alleging that a stan- dard contract term contradicts or un- reasonably limits an affirmation of fact or promise under subsection (b)(1) has to prove the existence of such affirma- tion of fact or promise. It would be eas- ier to prove the claimed prior affirma- tion of fact or promise if it is part of the core deal terms or if it were made in the form of a public advertisement. It would be more difficult for a consumer to prove the claimed prior affirmation of fact or promise if it were made pri- vately in the form of an oral statement by an agent of the business to the con- sumer. (See &#167; 9.) If the consumer pro- vides evidence of the affirmation of fact or promise, the business may then seek to demonstrate circumstances that ren- der its affirmation or promise nonde- ceptive, for example, by showing that additional pre-contractual communi- cations between the parties reflected the provision subsequently adopted in the standard contract terms. While the present Section deals with unen- forceability of standard contract terms that unreasonably negate the consum- er&#8217;s expectations formed by prior affir- mations of fact and promises, &#167;&#167; 8&#8211;9 address the enforceable contractual rights consumers acquired as a result of these expectations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b)(2) establishes that it is deceptive to make a false or mis- leading representation about material terms of the contract, including ele- ments of the price, when such repre- sentations (which can occur through an omission) take the passive form of obscuring or deprioritizing critical in- formation. Businesses naturally highlight <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>positive and favorable aspects of the product and the transaction, but when the practices of selective presen- tation of information manipulatively obscure the less favorable but critical aspects, they have a deceptive quality (see &#167; 6(d)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In many consumer contracts, price is multidimensional, comprised of dif- ferent fees, rates, discounts, rebates, add-ons, etc. It is misleading for a business to unduly emphasize certain price dimensions as part of the core deal terms, while relegating other price dimensions to the non-core stan- dard contract terms, if such emphasis obscures the total cost. When certain price dimensions are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, it is deceptive for a business to make a false or misleading affirmation of fact or promise about the likely occurrence or nonoccurrence of such events. It is also deceptive to induce consumers to pay an additional price for add-ons or services that are reasonably available to the consumer for little or no charge, implicitly representing that such pay- ments are necessary to obtain the ser- vices.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Subsection (b)(3) establishes that it is deceptive to invite consumers into a transaction while obscuring the fact that beneficial attributes consumers reasonably expect from such transac- tions, and which are central to their contracting decision, are absent. As in the other examples listed in subsection (b), this provision protects reasonable expectations of consumers regarding the core deal terms, which are created or exploited by the business to secure consumers&#8217; assent to the transaction. An attempt by the business to obscure facts that conflict with consumers&#8217; rea- sonable expectations is equivalent to an assertion that the facts do not exist. (See generally Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 161(b), 211(3).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In both subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), a deceptive obscuring may be done af- firmatively, as when information neces- sary to correct misperceptions is over- shadowed by other terms the business prioritizes. The obscuring may also re- sult from an omission by the business, as when the business has reason to be- lieve that the consumer reasonably but mistakenly expects a particular term or a particular benefit and fails to cor- rect that expectation. A business that discloses part of the truth about the transaction but fails to add qualifica- tions or other information necessary to avoid a reasonable but mistaken expec- tation by the consumer engages in both an act and an omission that obscure a term or a fact. (Cf. Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Econom- ic Harm &#167; 5, Comment <i>e</i>.)</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">1. A business advertises on its website a &#8220;complete assembled product,&#8221; but the product is deliv- ered as a &#8220;do it yourself&#8221; kit for as- sembly by the consumer. The stan- dard contract terms to which the consumer clicked &#8220;I Agree&#8221; when purchasing the product contained a disclaimer: &#8220;notwithstanding any representation made elsewhere, it is agreed that the product will be delivered unassembled and will re- quire further assembly by the con- sumer.&#8221; The explicit advertisement on the website, which is an affirma- tion of fact, is deceptive, and the disclaimer in the standard contract terms is not enforceable. (Cf. UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316(1).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A business sells a product along with the statement: &#8220;free can- cellations with full refunds, without restrictions, up to 90 days, no ques- tions asked.&#8221; During checkout, the consumer agrees to Terms and Con- ditions that contain a provision per- mitting cancellations and refunds of the purchased product only if it <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>has not been used. The &#8220;free can- cellations&#8221; affirmation is deceptive, and the limitation on refunds in the standard contract terms is not en- forceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer orders a con- cert ticket on a website. On the checkout web page, a service fee of $10 appears, as well as a prominent link to &#8220;Terms and Conditions.&#8221; The consumer manifests assent to the transaction by clicking &#8220;I Agree.&#8221; Among the standard contract terms in the &#8220;Terms and Conditions&#8221; page is a two-dollar surcharge added to all services, to be charged separate- ly to the consumer&#8217;s credit card. The representation that the service fee amounts only to $10 is deceptive, and the two-dollar surcharge term is not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A business advertises a &#8220;Free Phone&#8221; for new customers joining the service. An easily visible asterisk is attached to the phrase &#8220;Free Phone&#8221; referring the recip- ient to an easily findable footnote, printed at the bottom of the adver- tisement page, which states: &#8220;some fees, taxes, and charges may apply.&#8221; The consumer is charged a sales tax and connection fees when receiving the phone. The &#8220;Free Phone&#8221; affir- mation in the advertisement is not deceptive, and the provisions in the footnote are adopted as part of the contract because the qualification was presented in a manner that is reasonable and therefore becomes part of the affirmation itself.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. The website of a vacation resort advertises its well-equipped guest rooms, a rich breakfast buf- fet, and a lively pool scene. A notice, in small font, presented on the web page in a manner that need not be viewed by a consumer who com- pletes a booking, states that the pool is undergoing repairs and will not be available during the month of August. A consumer books a va- cation for a week in August. A rea- sonable consumer would expect, based on the prominent depiction of the pool scene, that pool services be available, and the failure of the business to correct that expecta- tion obscures the fact that they are not available and is deceptive. If, however, the notice concerning the pool&#8217;s maintenance is presented in a conspicuous manner, such that a consumer completing the booking is not likely to overlook it, the ex- clusion of the pool amenity from the transaction is not deceptive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A budget airline advertises low-cost flights to consumers by of- fering the option of paying separate- ly for checked-in luggage and for advance seat selection, two common features in budget airline travel. A consumer books a flight online and chooses to forgo advanced payment for checked-in luggage at a cost of $25 per item. A notice at the bottom of the checkout page, in small font, states that &#8220;additional baggage fees may apply.&#8221; At the airport, the con- sumer checks in a luggage item and is charged a $100 fee. A reasonable consumer would not expect such a significantly increased fee, and the business&#8217;s failure to provide a more conspicuous and specific alert regarding the fee differential is de- ceptive. If, instead, the website&#8217;s reservation page displays an alert, which the consumer must acknowl- edge, that a $100 baggage fee would apply to non-reserved checked-in baggage, the term is not deceptive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Deception as to value.</i> An affir- mation of fact or promise is deceptive if it would imply to a reasonable con- sumer that the contract&#8217;s value sub- stantially exceeds the actual value a consumer derives from the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A business sells a kitchen appliance and with it sells, for an additional price, a two-year service contract commencing on the date of purchase. The appliance comes with a manufacturer&#8217;s warranty offering the same protection as the service contract, albeit for a period of one year. Selling the service contract is deceptive unless the business explains that the service contract provides only one year of additional coverage.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Deception in solicitation of acceptance.</i> It is deceptive to solicit consumers&#8217; entry into an ancillary con- tract without their knowledge. Such deception may be done by inducing the consumer to receive and not reject an unsolicited free product, accompanied by standard terms that, unbeknownst to the consumer, stipulate recurring deliveries by the business at a stated price. &#8220;Negative option&#8221; contracts can be beneficial, as they allow consumers to receive uninterrupted services with- out the hassle of having to renew them. However, &#8220;negative options&#8221; are decep- tive when the business misrepresents the scope of acceptance, obscuring the obligation to pay and relegating it to the standard contract terms.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. A business offers a product to a consumer for free during a tri- al period and then charges the con- sumer periodically until she cancels the arrangement. Unless the auto- matic renewal is clearly stated in the inducing solicitation and the consumer is informed how to cancel the arrangement, it is deceptive.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. A business offers the con- sumer a service with &#8220;no contract.&#8221; The service is governed by stan- dard contract terms to which the consumer clicked &#8220;I Agree.&#8221; Those terms do not include any time com- mitment and do not reflect a termi- nation fee. The affirmation of &#8220;no contract&#8221; is not deceptive because consumers frequently view the term &#8220;no contract&#8221; as implying there is no long-term commitment and no termination fee. If, however, the standard contract terms contain a termination fee, the &#8220;no contract&#8221; affirmation is deceptive, and any term inconsistent with free exit is not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Relevance of reliance.</i> The rules in this Section provide for avoid- ance of a contract or term when that contract or term was agreed to &#8220;as a result of&#8221; a deceptive act or practice. Cf. Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 167 (When a Misrepre- sentation Is an Inducing Cause). The causation requirement can be satisfied either by (i) an actual-reliance require- ment (as in the common law of fraud; see Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Economic Harm &#167;&#167; 5, 11), or (ii) a requirement that consumers entering such transactions will be entitled to rely on the allegedly deceptive act or practice when agree- ing to the contract or term (compare the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Policy Statement on Deception (1983), which rejects an actual-reliance requirement and states that deception occurs when a material representation or omission is &#8220;likely to mislead&#8221; consumers acting reasonably in the circumstances; see also the &#8220;basis of the bargain&#8221; test un- der UCC &#167; 2&#8211;313). Elaborating on in- terpretation (ii), a deceptive advertise- ment can affect the market equilibrium (e.g., by raising the market price) and may thus affect all consumers alike, in- cluding those who were not aware of it and did not rely on it. Accordingly, de- ception under this Section could result in the avoidance of a contract or term even if the specific consumer-plaintiff did not see the advertisement. The rule in this Section is also consistent with the general principle of estoppel, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>prevents a business that engaged in a deceptive act or practice from claiming a right to the detriment of a consumer who was entitled to rely on the busi- ness&#8217;s conduct.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. Effects of deception.</i> The ordi- nary consequence of a conflict between an affirmation of fact or promise and a standard contract term under this Sec- tion is the removal of the standard con- tract term from the agreement to the extent necessary to avoid the conflict. If severance of specific standard con- tract terms is not sufficient to undo the conflict with the affirmation of fact or promise, the consumer may avoid the contract in its entirety. Any terms void- ed under this Section may be replaced by provisions consistent with the affir- mation of fact or promise made to the consumer and, if necessary, by gap-fill- ers in accordance with the guidelines in &#167; 10.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Shield versus sword.</i> A de- ception claim can be used as a defense (&#8220;shield&#8221;). For example, if a business sues to collect money charged to, but unpaid by, the consumer, the consumer can defend by showing that the charge had arisen from a deceptive term. The same deception claim can be made by the consumer as a plaintiff if, for ex- ample, a deceptive charge was already collected by the business and the con- sumer is suing to recover it. In that procedural posture, it is sometimes said that the deception claim is used as a &#8220;sword.&#8221; That description is mis- leading. The deception claim is used to challenge the business&#8217;s exercise of an alleged contractual right, as in the tra- ditional &#8220;shield&#8221; cases. A true &#8220;sword&#8221; application would arise if the consumer had a cause of action for the mere in- clusion of a deceptive term in the con- tract. See &#167; 6, Comment <i>12</i>; &#167; 10. Some state consumer-protection laws create a deception-based affirmative right of action and allow consumers to sue for statutory damages. Misrepresenta- tions may also give rise to tort claims, with additional remedies that the con- sumer-plaintiff may recover. Such stat- utory and tort claims fall outside the scope of this Restatement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Relation to other law.</i> The rules restated in this Section are relat- ed to several other legal doctrines, both within and beyond traditional contract law:</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(a). Law of pre-contractual mis- representation.</i> This Section is consis- tent with the general principle that agreements reached as a result of a material misrepresentation are not binding. See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, Chapter 7, Topic 1. It is also consistent with the tort of misrepresentation. See Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Eco- nomic Harm &#167;&#167; 5, 9, and 15. Whereas the standard result of pre-contractual misrepresentation under contract law is to render the entire agreement void- able, and under tort law to recover the pecuniary loss caused by reliance on the misrepresentation, this Section as an alternative enables courts to strike the standard contract terms that are inconsistent with the affirmations of facts or promises and enforce the re- mainder of the contract (see &#167; 10), thereby protecting the consumer&#8217;s for- ward-looking expectation. That result is often more practical and favorable to consumers than outright cancellation of the contract or the recovery of reli- ance damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(b). Federal and state anti-decep- tion law.</i> This Section is consistent with federal and state anti-deception law, but it restates only the common law consequences of deception and does not incorporate the tests and remedies of that anti-deception law. At both the federal and state level, statutory law, as applied by agencies and courts, protects consumers against deception. Those laws share the same objectives as the common law&#8217;s rules that are re- stated in this Section&#8212;to prevent deceptive <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>affirmations of fact or promis- es. They often provide redress beyond the avoidance of a contract or term or the enforcement of a specific contract. Primarily, those laws seek to prohib- it specific deceptive acts and provide remedies&#8212;both injunctions and dam- ages&#8212;for violations. This Section does not expand the reach of the statutory anti-deception law, nor does this Sec- tion incorporate that law, but this Sec- tion clarifies an additional consequence of deception&#8212;the non-enforceability, within the scope of this Section, of some contract terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(c). Parol evidence rule.</i> This Sec- tion affects the resolution of conflicts between standard contract terms and prior oral representations and, spe- cifically, prevents standard contract terms from overriding or modifying prior affirmations of fact or promises that are part of the bargain in fact. See, in particular, subsection (b)(1). While the common law&#8217;s parol evidence rule generally gives precedence to written terms over prior oral statements, the fraud or misrepresentation exception to the parol evidence rule is consistent with the rule restated in this Section. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 214(d).) Indeed, the parol evidence rule gives precedence to a written document when the parties in- tend for that document to be the only source of their contractual obligations (superseding prior oral or written agreements and contemporaneous oral agreements); no such intent can be in- ferred when an affirmation of fact or promise is deceptively undermined by the standard contract terms that are only weakly scrutinized by consumers. See also &#167; 9.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>(d). Exclusion or modification of warranties.</i> Some of the rules restat- ed in this Section prevent a business from making an express promise and then attempting to exclude or modify this promise in the standard contract terms. See, in particular, subsection (b)(1). These rules are consistent with UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316, which requires that an express warranty and its disclaimer &#8220;be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other&#8221; or, when that cannot be done, requires that the limitation be rendered inoperative.

<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. Generally.</i> Consumer con- tracts are often preceded by various affirmations of fact and promises that are intended to arouse consumer in- terest in the subject matter of the con- tract, to create their expectations about specific attributes of the transaction, to increase consumers&#8217; willingness to pay the quoted price, and ultimately to en- courage consumers to enter a contract. These communications include repre- sentations and warranties about the product or service that the consumer is acquiring but can also relate to other matters, such as the rights of the con- sumer, comparative cost, price, and discounts (including rebates). The com- munications can be done through adver- tising, product claims, demonstrations, samples, representations by business- es&#8217; agents, and various other ways that can be reasonably understood by con- sumers as supplying concrete informa- tion about the transaction, or any other form of communication in the course of contracting (see &#167; 1), as well as commu- nications made in the pre-contractual phase by parties who are not in imme- diate contractual relation with the con- sumer but who have an appreciable fi- nancial interest in the transaction. The communications may also be done after the consumer manifests assent to the transaction, through manuals, warran- ty statements, and other channels that continue to inform consumers about the subject matter of the contract. This Section is intended to hold the busi- ness to the truth of those affirmations and promises. It thus serves several purposes. First, it affords protection to consumers&#8217; reasonable expectations. Second, it enables businesses to make credible representations and to be tak- en seriously by their target customers. Third, it reduces consumers&#8217; need to rely on more expensive search and ver- ification tools and thus improves the efficiency of the marketplace.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Reasonable expectations.</i> An obligation under this Section arises from an affirmation of fact or a promise that creates reasonable expectations by a consumer who is their intended audience that the subject matter of the contract will have the described attri- butes. The test is an objective one&#8212;whether a reasonable consumer would have formed such expectations&#8212;and does not require proof of the specific ex- pectation formed by the particular con- sumer. Factors such as the materiality, salience, and prominence; specificity and definiteness; certainty; and verifi- ability of the representation determine whether the representation is indica- tive of a commitment and is made part of the consumer contract. Vague state- ments by the business are interpreted in accordance with the meaning lay consumers would reasonably attribute to them. Sales talk that is reasonably understood as &#8220;puffing&#8221; or statements of opinion do not become part of the basis of the bargain. (See generally Restatement of the Law Second, Con- tracts &#167; 211(3).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Advertising.</i> A contractual ob- ligation can arise based on affirmations or promises made in advertising. In the context of advertising, some puffing is <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>more likely and therefore some degree of skepticism about the information content is reasonable. Nevertheless, language in advertising that is specific and/or reasonably indicative of com- mitment should be treated no differ- ently than such language used in any other context.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A business advertises that a piece of gaming hardware is com- patible with gaming software of another system. A consumer pur- chases the gaming hardware. The advertisement creates an obligation that the device be compatible with the other system.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Timing of affirmations or promises.</i> Normally, the affirmations or promises that are part of the consumer contract are made prior to the consum- er&#8217;s manifestation of assent. However, this Section does not restrict its appli- cation to such pre-contractual state- ments. Some are made after the con- sumer manifests assent, in accordance with &#167; 2, or in the course of a modifica- tion of the contract. (See generally Uni- form Commercial Code (UCC) &#167; 2&#8211;313, Official Comment 7 (explaining that a post-assent affirmation or promise can become a modification).) It is common for warranty statements to be sealed in the box, and consumers reasonably expect the party making the warranty to stand by its promise.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. One year after purchas- ing a software program, a con- sumer receives a notice from the business that an update is avail- able for download. The notice also highlights some new functionalities of the updated version and a state- ment that it is compatible with more hardware platforms. The consumer downloads the software update. The notice creates an obligation that the updated version conform to the de- scription.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer purchases a car from a dealership. Two weeks later, on an icy day, when the con- sumer picks up the car from the lot, in response to the consumer&#8217;s inquiry, the salesperson tells the consumer that the car is equipped with anti-lock brakes. The affirma- tion becomes part of the consumer contract, which thus includes an ob- ligation to supply anti-lock brakes.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer purchases an appliance from a store along with an installation and extended-ser- vice contract. Two week later, when the appliance is delivered and in- stalled, the store&#8217;s installer tells the consumer that the service contract includes a 10 percent discount on parts. The affirmation becomes part of the consumer contract, which thus includes the 10 percent dis- count.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Affirmations of fact and prom- ises made by third parties&#8212;general.</i> In many markets, the parties that make such affirmations and promises are the ones who participate in earlier (and sometimes subsequent) links of the chain of distribution and who benefit directly from an increased volume of purchases by consumers, but who do not deal directly with the consumers and thus do not have contractual priv- ity. For example, original manufac- turers make various representations through ads and labels directed at the consumer, but they are not a party to the subsequent retail contract, which is concluded between a consumer and the retail outlet. In some cases, there is a post-purchase formation of a separate contract with the manufacturer (as, for example, when a consumer installs a computer or software purchased from a retailer and is asked to adopt addi- tional terms provided by the computer manufacturer or the software transferor). <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>See &#167; 2 Comment <i>8</i>. But often there is only one contract, with the direct re- tailer. Nevertheless, consumers&#8217; inter- est in that transaction may have been triggered, in significant part, by repre- sentations made by such third parties, and those representations are as much a part of the contract, in the mind of consumers, as if the retailer made them. This is also the case when a warranty statement by a third party is sealed in the box. (See Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2301, which contemplates liability by a supplier making a warranty to a remote pur- chaser.) While consumers rarely see the warranties before entering the contract with the business, their ex- pectation that a warranty attached to a product will create a binding obligation often drives the consumers&#8217; willingness to enter the contract. Subsection (b) provides consumers protection that is not diminished by the technical separa- tion between the representing and the transacting businesses. Consumers are often unaware of this separation, and the burden to become aware of such matters would be expensive and ineffi- cient.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. Affirmations of fact or prom- ises by third parties&#8212;liability of the business.</i> An obligation of the busi- ness can arise from pre-contractual affirmations of fact or promises made by other parties if the consumer could reasonably view the business as stand- ing behind the affirmation or promise and the business knew or should have known of the affirmation or promise. Those third parties are typically par- ties who are prior links in the normal chain of distribution or are involved in procuring customers for the business. In those circumstances, the affirma- tions or promises that contribute to the consumer&#8217;s willingness to enter into the contract and to pay for its subject matter directly benefit the business (i.e., the retailer). Further, consumers often do not know which entity is re- sponsible for making the affirmation or promise&#8212;whether it is the entity with whom they transact or a prior link in the chain of distribution&#8212;and reason- ably believe that the business intends to stand behind the claims made in the affirmations or promises. It would be both inefficient and unfair to place on consumers the burden of distinguish- ing between the representing and con- tracting parties. Thus, even a business that did not know of such affirmations or promises may nevertheless be bound to them, unless it can also be estab- lished by the business that it could not have reasonably known of them. The rule in subsection (b)(1) does not apply to standard terms supplied by the third party, such as warranty statements sealed in the box, unless the third par- ty made reference to those terms in a manner that could reasonably have brought them to the attention of the consumer and the business prior to the contract. But, under subsection (b)(2), such standard terms may create a di- rect obligation of the third party to the consumer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Affirmations of fact or prom- ises by third parties&#8212;liability of third party.</i> A third party that makes an affirmation of fact or a promise that creates a reasonable expectation by a reasonable consumer who is its intend- ed audience that the subject matter of the contract will have the described at- tribute may be independently obligated under subsection (b)(2) to ensure that the contract conforms to its affirmation of fact or promise&#8212;even if it does not contract directly with the consumer. Such an obligation to a remote con- sumer is consistent with the manifest intention of the party making the af- firmation of fact or promise and with long-standing market norms. For ex- ample, a &#8220;limited warranty&#8221; statement enclosed in the box by a manufacturer who has not contracted directly with the consumer creates an obligation on the manufacturer to stand by its promise. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(Cf. &#167; 2 Comment <i>8</i> (explaining when the obligation by a third party is adopted as part of the contract).)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This obligation generally applies to third-party businesses in the sup- ply chain, such as a manufacturer or wholesale distributor, that have an appreciable financial interest in the specific transaction that is the subject of the contract between the business and the consumer. But the obligation could potentially apply to third parties not in the supply chain but that none- theless have an appreciable financial interest in the specific transaction. For example, it could apply to affirmations or promises by a third party hired by the business to solicit customers for the business or by a trade organiza- tion representing a group of business- es with similar interests. In contrast, it would not apply to affirmations or promises by individual consumers based on their personal experiences with the business or the product or ser- vice, by agents of the consumer, or by independent testers and reviewers not affiliated with the business or others in the supply chain. Liability would chill the activity and speech of such third parties, and they would be unable to reallocate that liability to the business with which they do not have a contrac- tual relationship. In some circumstanc- es, however, the consumer may have a separate contractual relationship with advisors or other third parties who shape the consumer&#8217;s expectations and decisions, and separate causes of action may arise under those contracts.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A consumer purchases a car from a dealer and does not transact directly with the car&#8217;s man- ufacturer. The car comes with an owner&#8217;s manual from the manufac- turer that contains a &#8220;limited war- ranty,&#8221; which is intended to inform the consumer about the scope of the express warranty provided by the manufacturer. Under subsection (b) (2), the &#8220;limited warranty&#8221; creates a contractual obligation by the man- ufacturer to the consumer. Because the &#8220;limited warranty&#8221; does not cre- ate a reasonable expectation by the consumer that the dealer would be obligated on the warranty, it does not become part of the contract be- tween the consumer and the dealer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Inability to negate or limit the effects of an affirmation or promise</i>. When a business or third party makes an affirmation or promise that becomes part of the contract between the busi- ness and the consumer or creates an obligation of the third party toward the consumer, the effect of that affir- mation or promise cannot be negated or limited in the standard contract terms. (See also &#167; 9, Comment <i>3</i>; cf. UCC &#167; 2&#8211;316(1).) Note, however, that when an affirmation of fact or prom- ise contains its own limitation, the affirmation of fact or promise and the limitation must be construed whenev- er reasonable as consistent with each other, but the limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>9. Remedy.</i> Promises that be- come part of the contract under this Section, if they are not honored by the business or the third party, give rise to standard remedies for breach of con- tract. Affirmations of fact that become part of the contract under this Section, if not true, give rise to standard reme- dies for misrepresentation, and, when appropriate, for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>10. Relation to the Uniform Com- mercial Code and to warranty law.</i> The rule restated in subsection (a) is con- sistent with UCC &#167; 2&#8211;313 and reflects the application of the &#8220;basis of the bargain&#8221; principle beyond the sales-of- goods context without the use of that language. The rule restated in sub- section (b)(1), while formally broader than UCC &#167; 2&#8211;313, derives from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>same principle. The rule of subsection (b)(2) goes beyond existing obligations created under the UCC and reflects the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2301, which contemplates enforceable warranty obligations by re- mote &#8220;suppliers&#8221; to consumers and es- tablishes the format that such warran- ty statements, when made, must have.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 9. Standard Contract Terms and the Parol Evidence Rule</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A standard contract term that contradicts, unreasonably limits, or fails to give the effect reasonably expected by the consumer to a prior affirmation of fact or promise by the business does not constitute a final expression of the agreement regarding the subject matter of that term and does not have the effect under the parol evidence rule of discharging obligations that would otherwise arise as a result of the prior affirmation of fact or promise.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. Balancing two interests.</i> Con- sumer contracts, like all contracts, are subject to the parol evidence rule (Re- statement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167;&#167; 209&#8211;218). As that rule is stated in &#167; 213 of the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, a conclusion that an agreement is partially or complete- ly integrated&#8212;that is, that the agree- ment consists of a writing (including in electronic form) that constitutes a final expression of one or more terms of an agreement&#8212;has the effect of discharg- ing prior agreements. In consumer contracts, the finality provided by the parol evidence rule protects an import- ant interest of the business in certain- ty and security. But such finality might undermine the interest of consumers in enforcing their reasonable expecta- tions as formed by affirmations of fact or promises made outside the standard contract terms. Since the standard con- tract terms do not result from a com- bined effort by both parties to draft a negotiated agreement, there is less justification to view them as a joint affirmative memorialization of a mutu- ally designed agreement, and thus less reason to allow them to override affir- mations of fact or promises made to the consumer. Accordingly, when standard contract terms are inconsistent with prior affirmations of fact or promises, this Section denies those terms the preclusive effect of the parol evidence rule. It accomplishes this by negating the prerequisite for finding an inte- grated agreement&#8212;the conclusion that the standard contract terms constitute a final expression of those terms. This is consistent with &#167; 8, which holds that such affirmations of fact or promis- es are part of the contract and cannot be undone by standard contract terms (see &#167; 8(c)). Indeed, an attempt to use standard contract terms to contradict or unreasonably limit an affirmation or promise is deceptive under &#167; 7. The re- sult stated in this Section is, therefore, a logical corollary of &#167;&#167; 7 and 8. Such an attempt to use standard contract terms to contradict or unreasonably limit an affirmation or promise is also procedur- ally unconscionable under 6(d). In tan- dem, these rules protect expectations of consumers that reasonably arise from representations made by the business and that are central to consumers&#8217; deci- sion to enter the transaction. (See gen- erally Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 211(3), which provides that standard contract terms that &#8220;eviscer- ate&#8221; the terms explicitly represented to consumers, or that &#8220;eliminate the dom- inant purpose of the transaction,&#8221; are not enforceable.) Section 9 is not a com- plete statement of the parol evidence rule and does not supplant or derogate <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>from other limitations on the parol evi- dence rule that might apply.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A consumer who lives in an area with frequent, heavy snow- falls enters into a contract with a snow-removal business to shov- el her sidewalk the day following snowfalls of two inches or more. During the negotiations, the busi- ness&#8217;s representative assures the consumer that all snow removal will be completed by 10 a.m. on the day of removal. This is important to the consumer because a local ordinance requires sidewalks to be shoveled by that time. The written agreement signed by the consumer and the business, however, contains a standard contract term stating that the business promises only to complete snow removal by sunset on the day of removal. That stan- dard contract term contradicts the prior promise that snow will be re- moved by 10 a.m. Accordingly, the &#8220;snow removal by sunset&#8221; term in the written agreement does not con- stitute the parties&#8217; final expression of the timing term.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A consumer enters a deal- ership to buy a vehicle and, after the consumer identifies a satisfac- tory model for purchase, the dealer promises that delivery will occur within 10 weeks. The time of deliv- ery is important for the consumer because they will be renting a ve- hicle until delivery. The consumer manifests assent to the transaction by signing the dealership&#8217;s Contract for Sale. That document makes no reference to delivery obligations by the seller. It contains a merger clause. The absence of a statement or any reference to the promised delivery does not discharge the ob- ligation of the business that arose from the promise to deliver within 10 weeks.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A consumer visits a health club with an interest in becoming a member. After an agent for the club gives the consumer a tour of the facilities and explains membership fees and costs of said membership, the consumer requests an addition- al period to make a final decision. The agent presents the consum- er with a Membership Contract which the consumer signs after the agent assures the consumer that it will not go into effect upon sign- ing, promising that the consumer may take additional time to make a final decision and give express approval. The standard contract terms in the Membership Contract contain an initiation term that con- tradicts the agent&#8217;s assurance that the agreement will not be effective immediately. The initiation term in the written agreement does not constitute the parties&#8217; final expres- sion of agreement regarding the ef- fective date of the membership, and the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence of the condition precedent represented orally to the consumer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer purchases a mortgage protection insurance pol- icy and demands and receives an express assurance from an agent of the insurer that upon his death, the benefit paid to his spouse will equal the outstanding mortgage balance on their home plus an ad- ditional $50,000. Upon the consum- er&#8217;s death, the insurer pays only the mortgage balance and points to the written provisions of the standard form insurance policy, which set the benefit to equal the outstanding mortgage balance and contain no reference to the additional $50,000 benefit. There is no other evidence in the record indicating that the con- sumer knew or should have known that the policy did not contain the expanded benefit the agent led him to believe would be in it. The parol <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>evidence rule does not bar evidence of the oral promise that coverage will include an additional $50,000.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Demonstrating prior affirma- tions of fact or promises.</i> A consumer may demonstrate that a standard con- tract term contradicts, unreasonably limits, or fails to give the reasonably intended effect to a prior affirmation of fact or promise by the business even when the standard contract term is unambiguous. Accordingly, in consum- er contracts, the &#8220;four corners test&#8221; does not apply, and a determination of integration must be informed by the alleged prior affirmations of fact or promises. (See Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 209, Comment <i>c</i>.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>3. Merger clauses.</i> Consumer contracts often contain &#8220;merger claus- es&#8221; stating that there are no affirma- tions of fact, promises, or agreements between the parties except those found in the writing. Because consumers are not likely to notice, read, or understand the effect of such merger clauses, they do not ordinarily control the conclusion of whether the standard contract terms constitute a partially or completely in- tegrated agreement, and thus do not preclude a finding that the standard contract terms do not constitute the parties&#8217; final expression of a particular matter.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Relation to the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts, and the Uniform Commercial Code.</i> The rule of this Section supplements the ap- proach taken by Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 213. Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) &#167;&#167; 2&#8211;202 and 2A&#8211;202, which are similar in effect to &#167; 213 (although they employ a different structure and different terminology), are also triggered by a &#8220;final expres- sion.&#8221; As a result, this Section can be used to supplement those UCC provi- sions.</p>

<p class="indent">(a) If a contract, a term, or any group of terms is found to exclude, limit, or violate any mandatory provision of law, or is otherwise unen- forceable, then, in addition to any other remedy, it results in one of the following:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) non-enforcement of the contract,</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) enforcement of the remainder of the contract without the der- ogating term or terms, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) enforcement of the remainder of the contract with appropriate limits to the effects of the derogating term or terms.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) If the remainder of the contract is enforced, the derogating term may be replaced with:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) a term that is reasonable in the circumstances, including a term supplied or incorporated under any provision of the law,</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) a term that effects the minimal correction necessary to bring the contract into compliance with the mandatory rule, or</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) if the contravening term was placed by the business not in good faith, or if it purports to effect extreme derogation from a manda- tory provision of law, a term that is calculated in a manner proportional <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to the severity and willfulness of the derogation to give the business an incentive to avoid placing such terms in consumer contracts.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>1. General.</i> This Restatement contains several mandatory rules&#8212;rules that cannot be derogated from by agreement of the parties. (See, in particular, &#167; 3(c) (modifications must be made in good faith); &#167; 5(b) (consum- er contracts may not include a term purporting to grant the business the unbridled discretion to determine its contractual rights; obligations unre- strained by any good-faith obligation unenforceable); &#167; 6 (unconscionable terms or contracts are unenforceable); &#167; 7 (prohibition against engaging in de- ceptive acts or practices); &#167; 8 (contract terms limiting or negating affirmations of fact or promises that have become part of the consumer contract are un- enforceable).) Consumer contracts are also governed by additional mandatory rules&#8212;statutory or otherwise&#8212;beyond those in this Restatement, which ren- der specific terms of the contract unen- forceable. (See Comment <i>6</i>.) This Sec- tion describes the legal implications of an attempt by the business to derogate from those mandatory rules. It restates general principles of reformation of contracts and severability and applies them to consumer contracts. These le- gal implications are complementary to other remedies available under other law, including contract and tort law. The rules restated in this Section ap- ply when the business seeks to enforce a consumer contract and also when the consumer initiates an action with re- spect to the consumer contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>2. Severability.</i> When a term in a consumer contract violates a mandato- ry rule, the court may: (i) refuse to en- force the entire contract, (ii) sever the offending term and enforce the remain- der of the contract without it, or (iii) limit the application of the offending term. If the court enforces the contract without the offending term, it may fill the resultant gap as explained below.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The quality and magnitude of ref- ormation of the contract that the court exercises should be proportional to the severity and willfulness of the violation by the business. When the offending term is immaterial, it should be suffi- cient to sever the term and enforce the remainder of the contract. When the offending term is material, the court is more likely to refuse to enforce the entire contract. The presence of a sev- erability clause in the contract is rele- vant but not conclusive for severability and enforceability questions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In certain cases, when the offending term is material, the court may give the consumer a choice between either (i) severing the offending term and en- forcing the remainder of the contract, or (ii) treating the entire contract as unenforceable. In deception cases, when the term constitutes a deceptive act or practice under &#167; 7, the consum- er may be given that choice even if the term is immaterial.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. A contract contains a pro- vision that allows the business to amend any of the standard terms at its discretion, explicitly disavowing any good-faith or other constraint on the business&#8217;s discretion. The provision is material, and its effect is to render the contract illusory. The court should give deference to the consumer&#8217;s choice whether to sever the provision and enforce the remainder of the contract or treat the entire contract as unenforce- able.</p>

Gap-filling.</i> When the court decides to enforce the contract without the offending term, it may be required to fill a gap left by the unenforceable <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>term. For example, if a price term is excessive and unconscionable, or if a period of limitations is too short and unconscionable, the term will not be enforced&#8212;but what price or limitations period would fill the gap created by their severance? The rule in this Sec- tion treats this question as a gap-fill- ing problem. It offers three criteria of gap-filling. The first and principal criterion, stated in subsection (b)(1), requires the gap in the contract to be filled with a reasonable term&#8212;the term that reasonable parties would choose in the circumstances. Often, this would be the same gap filler incorporated under provisions of the law when the contract is silent on the matter. This is the ap- proach to gap-filling found in the Uni- form Commercial Code, Article 2, Part 3. In deception cases, when the term violates &#167; 7 and the consumer elects to avoid only the specific terms that are inconsistent with an affirmation of fact or a promise, the gap created by the re- moval of the inconsistent term is filled by terms that reflect the affirmation of fact or the promise, supplemented as necessary by legally supplied gap fill- ers. This form of redress protects the consumer&#8217;s reasonable expectations under the contract and allows the con- sumer to recover the benefit of the bar- gain.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Often, however, there is a range of reasonable terms, and it is within the court&#8217;s discretion to choose a reason- able term along that range. If the of- fending term was placed in the contract by the business in a reasonable at- tempt to protect a material interest of the business, subsection (b)(2) enables the court to fill the gap while preserv- ing as much of the original agreement as may properly survive the severance of the offending portion. Once the of- fending feature of the term is removed, the additional protection to which the consumer is entitled ends, and there are no additional grounds for interven- tion and for further severance.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">If, instead, the offending term was placed in the contract by the business not in good faith, for example, when the business knew that the term as drafted included aspects that were un- enforceable, subsection (b)(3) enables the court to fill the gap with a term calculated to give the business an in- centive to avoid such drafting. In that case, the invalidated term is replaced with a term that operates against the business to an extent proportionate to the deviation from good faith. (Com- pare the interpretation principle of <i>contra proferentem</i> in Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts &#167; 206.)</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. A contract contains an arbitration clause that requires consumers to arbitrate under the auspices of a specified arbitration forum. The clause is unconscionable under &#167; 6 because the named arbi- tration forum is known for using pro-business, biased arbitrators. If the business did not know about this bias and chose the arbitration forum innocently, subsection (b)(1) allows the court to replace the contractually specified arbitration forum with another arbitration fo- rum that the court considers most reasonable in the circumstances, reflecting the most common market practices in similar transactions. Subsection (b)(2) allows the court to replace the contractually specified forum with arbitration that most resembles the proceedings in the named forum, but one that is free from bias. This solution preserves, as much as possible, the original agreement and should apply only if the business was not aware of the scam when it named the arbitration forum in its contract. Additionally, subsection (b)(3) allows the court to replace the biased arbitration forum with a dispute-resolution clause that gives the business an incentive <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to avoid drafting such terms. For example, the court may let the consumer choose a forum, includ- ing litigation in court. This solution should apply if the business knew about the arbitrators&#8217; bias.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A contract contains an ar- bitration clause that requires con- sumers to arbitrate at a forum that charges a filing fee that is held to be excessively high and thus uncon- scionable under &#167; 6. If the business should have known with reasonable certainty that this element of the arbitration clause would unreason- ably limit the consumer&#8217;s ability to pursue or express a complaint or seek reasonable redress for a vio- lation of a legal right, the entire arbitration clause may be severed under subsection (b)(3), and the consumer may then be entitled to bring an action in court. If, instead, the inclusion of the unconscionable element was done in good faith, the court may decide to sever only the offending element (say, by allow- ing the business to reimburse the consumer for the excessive portion of the filing fee or by switching to arbitration at a different forum that does not charge the high filing fee).</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A consumer borrows $5,000 under a three-year, unse- cured loan contract carrying an in- terest rate of 135 percent. The in- terest rate is unconscionable under &#167; 6. The court may adjust the inter- est rate to reflect the rate prevailing for similar loans (under subsection (b)(1)). Alternatively, the court may adjust the interest rate to the high- est level that, in the circumstances, is not substantively unconsciona- ble (under subsection (b)(2)). If the court concludes that the violation was deliberate and in not in good faith, it may, under subsection (b) (3), further reduce the interest rate. These adjustments of the interest rate are in addition to any other sanctions stipulated by law.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A contract contains a ser- vice-warranty provision but grants the business the power to modify the terms of the warranty and ap- ply the new terms to past trans- actions entered into prior to the modification. The warranty-service agreement explicitly conflicts with the requirements of &#167;&#167; 3 and 5. The court may substitute a reasonable warranty clause (under subsection (b)(1)) or merely remove the retro- activity element (under subsection (b)(2)). If the court concludes that the violation was deliberate, it may substitute a warranty-service agreement that is especially protec- tive of consumers (under subsection (b)(3)).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>4. Extreme derogation from man- datory provisions of law.</i> If the violat- ing term is plainly illegal, deviating in an extreme manner from the bounds of permissible contracting, such that any competent lawyer could recognize its unenforceability and could draft in a straightforward manner a provision that does not impose such extreme derogation, subsection (b)(3) should apply, even if it cannot be shown that the business deliberately deviated from the standards of good faith.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. A contract contains an ex- culpatory clause that absolves the business from liability for personal injuries due to any factor, including gross negligence and intentional wrongdoing. A consumer was in- jured due to ordinary negligence of the business. Because of the sub- stantial overbreadth of the clause, the court may decline to narrow the exculpatory clause and, instead, under subsection (b)(3), strike it entirely, even without a finding a deliberate deviation from the stan- dards of good faith on the part of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>business. As a result, even if courts in the jurisdiction generally enforce exculpatory clauses for ordinary negligence, the result of striking the exculpatory clause entirely is to allow a consumer to bring a claim for ordinary negligence.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>5. Enforcement by the consumer.</i> While an offending contract or term cannot be enforced by the business against the consumer, the consumer has no obligation to assert that the contract or term is not enforceable and may choose to obtain the benefit of the agreement. If the consumer so chooses, the business may not assert that the contract or term is not enforceable.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>6. Other invalidating causes.</i> The methodology laid out in this Sec- tion also applies to situations in which a contract or term is found to violate mandatory rules that are not restated here. For example, when a term is un- enforceable because it is against pub- lic policy, or when it violates a statute, courts may need to supply an alterna- tive term, and the three gap-filling ap- proaches in subsection (b) of this Sec- tion provide guidance.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. A contract contains an ear- ly-termination fee that the court holds to be excessive and thus un- enforceable under the doctrine that requires liquidated damages to be reasonable (but the court does not determine it to be unconscionable). Under subsection (b)(1), the court would replace the fee with a rea- sonable fee. Under subsection (b) (2), the court would merely reduce the fee to the highest level that it determines is permissible under the penalty doctrine as applied to liqui- dated damages. Under subsection (b)(3), if the court determines that the excessive fee was included not in good faith, the court may reduce it to zero.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>7. Severability and savings clauses.</i> Contracts often include stan- dard contract terms that purport to resolve the reformation and gap-filling functions addressed by this Section. Such severability or savings clauses typically involve an instruction to par- tially enforce a provision in case it is found to violate legal limits, and do so &#8220;to the maximum extent permitted by law.&#8221; These contractual clauses may be given effect unless they conflict with the rules in this Section. For example, if it is found that the contravening term was placed by the business not in good faith, in circumstances that justify its replacement with a term calculated to give the business an incentive to avoid such drafting, the rule in subsection (b)(3) should override conflicting instruc- tions in the standard contract terms.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>8. Relation to Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts; the Uniform Commercial Code; and other law.</i> The rules of this Section are consistent with the approaches taken by courts when a term is deemed unconscionable under the provisions of the Uniform Commer- cial Code and the Restatement of the Law Second, Contracts (as explained in the preceding Comments). This Section goes further, however, restating the criteria courts deploy in adjusting the gap-filler to the circumstances that led to the inclusion of the offending term. It allows courts to choose the appro- priate degree to which the gap-filler is more favorable to the consumer than the term found to be in violation, de- pending on whether the violation was innocent or the court sees a need to discourage the business from over- reaching. Nothing in this Restatement is intended to replace causes of action or defenses arising under the common law not expressly addressed herein.</p>

<p class="center_hd"><b>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The law governing trades in commerce in the United States and in Europe has historically focused on trade in items that are either real property, goods, or intangible assets such as shares, receivables, intellec- tual property rights, licenses, etc. With the emergence of the data econ- omy, however, tradeable items often cannot readily be classified as such goods or rights, and they are arguably not services. They are often simply &#8220;data.&#8221; Both in the United States and in Europe, uncertainty as to the applicable rules and doctrines to govern the data economy is beginning to trouble stakeholders (such as data-driven industries, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as consumers). This uncertainty un- dermines the predictability necessary for efficient transactions in data, may inhibit innovation and growth, and may lead to market failure and manifest unfairness, in particular for the weaker party in a commercial relationship.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>A. Why Principles on Data Transactions and Data Rights?</b></p>
<p class="indent">The application of traditional legal doctrines to trades in data is not well developed, often does not fit the trade, and is not always useful or appropriate or even accomplished in a consistent manner. At the bottom of this uncertainty lies the fact that data is different from other resources in several ways, such as by being what has come to be called a &#8220;non-ri- valrous resource,&#8221; i.e., data can be multiplied at basically no cost and can be used in parallel for a variety of different purposes by many different people at the same time. When A sells a machine to B, A will no longer have the machine, but when A sells data to B, both A and B can have and use the data, and the multiplication of the data does not in any way reduce its practical utility (without prejudice to the fact that the market value of data may decrease rapidly with increasing numbers of persons having the data). Also, the way data can be shared or supplied differs significantly from the way goods are made available to others, and many transactions in the data economy do not have an analogy in traditional commerce. If A allows B to access data in a secure space on A&#8217;s servers <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>with an algorithm to run certain processing activities, this would be a very common type of transaction in the data economy, but there is no established body of applicable contract law that would fit precisely this type of transaction.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>*</sup></b> This material has been approved by The American Law Institute and the European Law Institute but the final text has not yet been published.</p>
<p class="indent">However, data is also different from intellectual property as, in the transactions usually considered to be part of the &#8220;data economy,&#8221; what is &#8220;sold&#8221; is not the permission to utilize an intangible but rather binary im- pulses with a particular meaning, usually as &#8220;bulk&#8221; or &#8220;serial&#8221; data. This focus on binary impulses in large batches, which may be stored, transmit- ted, processed with the help of machines, etc., is also what differentiates transactions in the data economy from traditional information services. When A pays B for gathering information on election outcomes in a for- eign country, the focus is on B <i>doing</i> something (i.e., telling A, even if A and B have agreed B must give A the information in a particular format, such as by email). By contrast, when A pays B for real time transmission of exit-poll data to be displayed on A&#8217;s news channel, the focus is on B <i>de- livering</i> something (i.e., a large batch of binary impulses with a particular meaning in a particular format).</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that data is different is the reason why it has become neces- sary to draft principles for data transactions and data rights instead of merely referring to the existing law of, say, sale and lease of goods, or of services. It is important to note that the legal analysis depends to a great degree on whether the relevant data is protected under rules such as in- tellectual property law or trade secret law and/or rules that limit certain types of conduct (such as data privacy/data protection law and consumer protection law).</p>
<p class="indent">This project seeks to propose a set of principles that might be imple- mented in any kind of legal environment, and to work in conjunction with any kind of data privacy/data protection law, intellectual property law, or trade secret law, without addressing or seeking to change any of the substantive rules of these bodies of law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>B. Players and Relations in the Data Ecosystem</b></p>
<p class="indent">These Principles cannot provide a complete set of standards for any sort of dealings within the data economy. This is so for a variety of rea- sons, including the special dynamics of the data economy as a fast-mov- ing field, the desire to reduce complexity and focus these Principles on some central points, and the need to produce something that works in vastly differing legal environments in different regions of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">These Principles have taken the basic types of players and relations that we find in data ecosystems as a starting point. The central player in all data ecosystems is the controller (often also called the &#8220;holder&#8221;) of data, i.e., the party that is in a position to access the data and that de- cides about the purposes and means of their processing. That controller may exercise control all by itself or share it with co-controllers, such as <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>under a data pooling arrangement. A (mere) processor of data, on the oth- er hand, is a service provider that processes data on a controller&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p class="indent">There is also a variety of different parties contributing in different ways to the generation of data. One important way of contributing to the generation of data is by being the individual or legal entity that is the subject of the information recorded in the data. Another way of contribut- ing to the generation of data is by being a data producer, i.e., generating data in the sense of recording information that had previously not been recorded. There are also parties that do not produce data in this sense, but create added value by assembling data in some meaningful ways, and parties that contribute in more remote roles. The parties that contribute to the generation of data may provide the data to the controller (provided data). Data may be produced by the controller itself through observing the parties (observed data). The controller may also obtain derived or inferred data from data that has been observed or provided.</p>
<p class="indent">A controller of data often supplies the data to third-party data recipi- ents, in particular under contractual or other data sharing arrangements. Recipients of data may become new controllers when data is fully trans- ferred to them, or they may receive only access to the data, such as when they are permitted to process data with a mobile software agent on the supplier&#8217;s server. Needless to say, an important part of the data economy consists in using data for creating new value, such as by developing and marketing data-based products and services; marketing these products and services is, however, not covered by these Principles.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the parties mentioned, there are an increasing number of different types of data intermediaries, such as data trustees, data es- crowees, or data marketplace providers. They facilitate the transactions between the different actors, in particular between parties generating data and data controllers, and between data suppliers and data recipi- ents, such as by acting as a trusted third party.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="head4"><b>C. Structure of these Principles</b></p>
<p class="indent"><i>a. Part I. General Provisions.</i> The first Part sets out the purpose and scope of these Principles and provides definitions of key terms that they utilize, such as &#8220;data,&#8221; &#8220;copy,&#8221; &#8220;processing,&#8221; &#8220;control of data,&#8221; and &#8220;supply&#8221; of data. In defining these terms, efforts have been made to ensure con- sistency with both established terminology worldwide and other ALI and ELI work. Finally, Part I addresses these Principles&#8217; impact on remedies.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>b. Part II. Data Contracts.</i> The second Part of these Principles is devoted to contracts the subject of which is data, establishing, in the first place, sets of default terms appropriate for different basic types of data transactions. While focusing on contracts, the default terms apply also, with appropriate adjustments, to the governing principles of similar ar- rangements, such as when a company or other legal entity is established <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>instead (e.g., for a data pooling arrangement). Part II begins by setting out, in Chapter A, some general provisions on the interpretation and ap- plication of these Principles to data contracts, including a general hierar- chy for determining the rules governing data contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter B is more specifically about contracts for supply or sharing of data. These Principles identify, as a first step, typical contractual prom- ises in the data economy that involve different types and modalities of provision of data, and show how these transactions in the data economy can be systematized, with a view to analyzing the rights and obligations of the parties to the transaction. These rights and obligations may be very different, depending on whether, e.g., a party has promised to fully transfer data to a medium within the recipient&#8217;s sphere of control, or only to grant access to a medium on which data is stored or maybe even only to consent to the collecting and processing of data by the other party to the transaction while refusing to take any responsibility for what the other party ultimately receives. When data is not just provided by a supplier to a recipient, but two or several parties decide to contribute data to a data pool or closed platform each of them has access to, this again may require a somewhat different set of rules. It should be noted that the terms &#8220;supply&#8221; and &#8220;sharing&#8221; may, by and large, be used interchangeably, even though &#8220;supply&#8221; fits better to describe a one-way provision of data. Among the policy choices recommended by these Principles in the context of supply or sharing of data is the default position that, when the data is fully transferred, the data may be used by the recipient for any lawful purpose that does not infringe the rights of third parties. (Thus, these Principles take a &#8220;sales approach&#8221; as opposed to a &#8220;license approach.&#8221;) Because, however, these Principles provide a wide berth for private or- dering, including provisions that emphasize freedom of contract except when limited by a mandatory rule of the applicable jurisdiction, parties will remain able to agree on arrangements close to a &#8220;data license,&#8221; as is frequently found in model agreements and in data contracts (even when the data is not protected by intellectual property law). For contracts in which the recipient is given only simple access to data on a medium con- trolled by the supplier, these Principles suggest the opposite default posi- tion (i.e., a &#8220;license approach&#8221;).</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter C deals with contracts whose focus is not the provision of data by one party to another, or the sharing of data among various parties, but rather the provision of services with regard to data. The most important contract type in this regard is contracts for the processing of data, in- cluding any cloud storage of data and any data analytics. Another type of contract addressed in Chapter C is a type that has been labeled, for lack of a better term, &#8220;data trust contracts,&#8221; although that term should not be taken as encompassing the specific legal implications of the common-law concept of trusts, and a related type of contract labeled &#8220;data escrow con- tracts.&#8221; Also, data marketplace contracts, which are essentially about the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>facilitation of data transactions and the matchmaking between parties, are dealt with under this Part.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="head2"><b>PART I <br/><br/>GENERAL PROVISIONS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 1. Purpose of these Principles</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) These Principles are intended for use in legal systems in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. They are designed to:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) bring coherence to, and move toward harmonization of, exist- ing law and legal concepts relevant for the data economy;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) be used as a source to inspire and guide the further develop- ment of the law by courts and legislators worldwide;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) inform the development of best practices and guide the de- velopment of emerging standards, including standards or trade codes that are specific to a particular industry or industry sector;</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) facilitate the drafting of model agreements or provisions to be used on a voluntary basis by parties in the data economy;</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) govern contracts or complement the law that governs them to the extent that they provide default rules or that parties to a trans- action have incorporated them into their contract or have otherwise designated them to govern; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(f) guide the deliberations of tribunals in arbitration and other dispute resolution forums.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) These Principles recommend a legal framework that is intended to work with any form of data privacy or data protection law, intellectual property law, or trade secrets law. These Principles are not intended to amend or create any such law, but they may inform the development of such law. In the event of any inconsistency between these Principles and such other law that cannot be overcome by interpretation, the other law should prevail.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Addressees and added value.</i> These Principles address a fast-emerg- ing but already major sector of the economy. Yet, this sector has developed largely without a legal framework that recognizes and reflects many of the sec- tor&#8217;s important and unique attributes in order to govern it in a way that thoughtfully balances and facilitates both the public interest and the private interests of the parties. These Prin- ciples are the result of collaborative work of lawyers from Europe and the United States. They are designed to provide guidance as to the basic princi- ples to be applied to data transactions and related matters irrespective of the otherwise applicable legal framework (whether that of a U.S. state or one of the European legal systems), and thereby seek to develop a consistent, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>general approach across national bor- ders and legal disciplines.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The purpose of these Principles is to provide guidance to and to inform par- ties, practitioners, arbitral tribunals, standardization bodies, courts, and leg- islators worldwide. They seek to pro- mote the enhancement and better ad- aptation of the law to the data economy as an ever more important part of the economy at large, and to identify guid- ing principles in dealing with data as an asset and tradeable item. By doing so, they facilitate the further develop- ment of the law by courts and legisla- tors worldwide, and the review of exist- ing law and soft law instruments by, in particular, legislative bodies, standard- ization agencies, or bodies developing codes of conduct. These Principles are also designed to facilitate the drafting of model agreements or provisions to be used on a voluntary basis by par- ties in the data economy. Equally, they may govern contracts or complement the law that governs contracts to the extent that they provide default rules or that parties to a transaction have incorporated them into their contract or have otherwise designated them to govern. These Principles may, in a sim- ilar vein, guide the deliberations of tri- bunals in arbitration and other dispute resolution forums (such as mediation). Depending on the specific needs and characteristics of a particular indus- try, these Principles may provide the basis for adaptation or extension for the development of industry-specific standards.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">By their very nature, some Parts of these Principles are addressed to par- ticular players more than to others. For instance, Part II on data contracts is addressed both to parties in the data economy (and to counsel advising those parties), bringing some clarity as to the main types of transactions and suggesting rules that could typical- ly be considered reasonable and fair, and to courts, which must deal with incomplete agreements and provide appropriate &#8220;gap fillers&#8221; when parties have failed to deal with important is- sues. Part III on Data Rights is pre- dominantly addressed to legislators and bodies developing standards and codes of conduct. However, it is also ad- dressed to parties, their legal advisers, and to courts dealing with issues that involve the relationship between, e.g., the users of goods, digital content, or services and the manufacturer, or be- tween the manufacturer and suppliers of components. Part IV may be seen to be addressed primarily to legisla- tors considering issues raised by the data economy, and to courts that have been called upon by a party, e.g., be- cause that party claims its rights have been infringed by some data activity. The same would hold true for Part V dealing with cross-border issues. How- ever, none of the Parts is exclusively targeted at the specific audiences just mentioned, and these Principles seek to provide added value to as broad a variety of actors as possible.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Relationship with specific ar- eas of the law not addressed by these Principles.</i> The data economy is a sub- ject that touches upon and cuts across many areas of the law. Most notably, data may in many instances be pro- tected by copyright or other intellectu- al property rights. In addition, to the extent that data is personal data (i.e., data relating to an identified, or iden- tifiable, natural person), data privacy/ data protection law provides for an ever more comprehensive set of rules. Another area of the law with a firmly established framework that addresses the protection of information and data is trade secret law. While these Princi- ples cannot entirely avoid referring to these areas of the law, they do not seek to restate what the rules in those ar- eas are or should be. Rather, they take those areas of the law as more or less given.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>For example, these Principles pro- pose rules to govern transactions in nonpersonal data as well as personal data, recognizing that the latter type of data may be subject to data privacy/ data protection regimes. These Princi- ples, in some cases, address some im- plications of such regimes for trade in data. But these Principles do not deal with issues fully covered by data pri- vacy/data protection law, such as when consent is necessary and/or can be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">1. Business S supplies an on- line video game and holds a broad range of personal data from users playing that game, much of which is protected under data privacy re- gimes such as the California Con- sumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). S &#8220;sells&#8221; the data of 20,000 users to data analytics business R in a way that is in conformity with the relevant data privacy regimes. Shortly after the data is transferred to R, 5,000 users from the Europe- an Union withdraw their consent to the processing of the data. As a re- action, R demands return of 25 per- cent of the price paid to S. As these Principles do not seek to restate or revise data privacy/data protection law, they do not deal with questions such as whether the users&#8217; consent may be withdrawn at any time, or whether the users have a right to object to the sale by clicking a but- ton stating &#8220;Do not sell my data&#8221; or the like. Rather, user rights under data privacy/data protection law are left to the applicable rules, con- sidering also the territorial scope of those rules. These Principles do, however, address the effect of data privacy/data protection regimes, and of rights exercised under such regimes, on the rights of parties to a data transaction such as the trans- action between S and B, e.g., wheth- er S would have been under a duty to make R aware of this risk and whether R has any rights against S because R ultimately lost 25 per- cent of what R had bargained for.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sometimes, the validity of a trans- action dealt with under these Prin- ciples will depend on such other law, e.g., when a transaction is blatantly inconsistent with data privacy/data protection law that may, depending on the circumstances, mean the transac- tion is illegal and thus void or voidable under the applicable law. That, too, is not a matter for these Principles to deal with.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">2. Assuming that, in a sce- nario such as that in Illustration no. 1, a large number of users failed to give their consent, or clicked the button &#8220;Do not sell my data,&#8221; and thus &#8220;sale&#8221; and transfer of the data by S to R was in violation of an ap- plicable data protection regime, and both S and R were aware of that. Whether that affects in any way the validity of the contract between S and R is not dealt with in these Principles. However, these Princi- ples do deal with what the unwind- ing of the transaction means with regard to the data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sometimes, different aspects of the same activity may be the subject of these Principles as well as other bodies of law. For instance, data porting (por- tability) rights are dealt with under Part III of these Principles, but they may also be an element of data pro- tection law, consumer protection law, or competition law. It is, in particular, in those grey zones that the other bod- ies of law would prevail in the event of any inescapable inconsistency between them and these Principles, but still these Principles might inform the de- velopment of those other bodies of law and point at directions of development <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>that might be more favorable than others for a flourishing data economy. For example, a major challenge for the data economy is that there is hardly any data pool that does not implicate potential issues arising from data pri- vacy/protection law (e.g., because some data in the pool is personal data, or can be de-anonymized in the future), intellectual property law (e.g., because some snippets of text might be protect- ed by copyright), or trade secrets law (e.g., because aggregated machine data allow conclusions about business oper- ations). This leads to reluctance on the part of businesses to share their data with others, as such sharing might indirectly expose them to requests for erasure, claims for damages, and other adverse consequences. The law should take these considerations into account when accommodating these diverse needs, and Principles 34, 36, and 37 in particular make some suggestions as to how this could be achieved.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Relationship with contract rules and doctrines.</i> The relationship of these Principles to existing law of sales and service contracts, such as can be found in European civil codes or in the Uniform Commercial Code or other statutes, is an entirely different story. There is a clear overlap between such areas of the law and these Principles, such as with regard to contractual rights and obligations of the parties. These Principles are inspired by those bodies of law and are guided by them, sometimes clarifying application of existing principles in the data context while other times providing a roadmap for future development. They seek to identify standards that, if adopted, would take priority over existing rules in these areas by tailoring their appli- cation to data transactions. The same holds true for unfair competition law, which, however, normally does not spe- cifically deal with data or information and would be informed by these Princi- ples only with regard to data economy scenarios.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">These Principles do not address general legal doctrines such as those governing formation of contracts or protections provided to consumers in consumer contracts, leaving those matters to existing law. Thus, these Principles do not differentiate between consumers and businesses as custom- ers. Rather than create new protective doctrines unique to this context, these Principles provide guidance as to the application in a data setting of existing protective rules and doctrines, which often differentiate between consumers and businesses. Whenever these Prin- ciples refer to &#8220;contract&#8221; or &#8220;contractu- al,&#8221; this automatically implies that all general contract law doctrines, wheth- er from statute or common law, apply, and that, when the contracting parties are a business and a consumer, all applicable consumer protection stan- dards remain unaffected. These doc- trines and standards vary from juris- diction to jurisdiction (e.g., notions of &#8220;unconscionability&#8221; and &#8220;unfairness&#8221; in business-to-business transactions may mean very different things in different jurisdictions), and it is not the purpose of these Principles to change, with re- gard to data, a more general approach taken by the contract law of a particu- lar jurisdiction on these matters.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Relationship with property law.</i> These Principles do not address whether rights in data are to be char- acterized as &#8220;ownership&#8221; or &#8220;property&#8221; (except, of course, when other law, such as intellectual property law or the like, affirmatively creates property rights), nor do they take any position in the controversy between more privacy-ori- ented and more property-oriented the- ories of data law. Rather, they describe the attributes of rights with regard to data without addressing the issue of &#8220;proper&#8221; doctrinal characterization as one or the other.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Principle 2. Scope of these Principles</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The primary focus of these Principles is on records of large quan- tities of information as an asset, resource, or tradeable commodity. These Principles do not address functional data, i.e., data the main purpose of which is to deliver particular functionalities (such as a computer pro- gram), and representative data, i.e., data the main purpose of which is to represent other assets or value (such as crypto-assets).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to paragraph (3), these Principles address:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) data contracts,</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) data rights, and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) third-party aspects of data contracts and data rights.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) These Principles are not designed to apply to public bodies inso- far as such bodies are engaging in the exercise of sovereign powers.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Focus on information.</i> The definition of &#8220;data&#8221; in Principle 3(1)(a) is broad. Applying these Principles to all rights and transactions about data (as so defined) would result in appli- cation of these Principles beyond their intended context. These Principles (as well as the terms &#8220;data contracts,&#8221; &#8220;data rights,&#8221; etc.) should be under- stood as covering only issues that have a primary focus on records of large quantities of information. They should not cover cases in which, e.g., the focus is on the medium itself, or on an entire- ly different aspect of data. This flexible approach allows for these Principles to be applied to the whole transaction, to be applied to a particular part or aspect of a transaction, or to not be applied at all when the &#8220;records of information&#8221; aspect is not the focus of the subject matter.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">3. A simple contract between a law firm and a client pursuant to which the law firm will represent the client in contract negotiations is not within the scope of these Principles even when it is anticipat- ed that the law firm will transmit proposed drafts of transactional documents in digital form through an electronic message system. This is because the focus of the contract between the law firm and the client is not on the records of information, but rather the legal advice as such. Of course, a wider relationship be- tween a law firm and a client may include aspects that are within the scope of these Principles, and that relationship may include, e.g., ac- cess to data or processing of data within the meaning of these Princi- ples.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The distinction between a primary focus on records of (large quantities of) information and a different focus is particularly relevant when it comes to digital phenomena that are not primar- ily considered as &#8220;data&#8221; even though, technically speaking, they have the same or a very similar nature. A com- puter program, for example, is primari- ly seen as a set of commands delivering particular functionalities (&#8220;functional data&#8221;). Cryptocurrencies and other tokens may be seen as, among other things, data packets, but clearly the focus is not on any value inherent in the information recorded in the to- kens, but rather on the off-ledger asset represented by them (&#8220;representative data&#8221;) or the on-ledger asset generat- ed by the fact that other members of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>community are prepared to trade them for value. This is why paragraph (1) of this Principle clarifies that these Prin- ciples do not address functional data or representative data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">4. A transfer of Bitcoins (a form of cryptocurrency) from wal- let holder A to wallet holder B is not a &#8220;data transaction&#8221; for pur- poses of these Principles because the transaction is primarily about a transfer of value represented by a virtual token and documented on the blockchain. Likewise, in-game purchase of a weapon or superpow- er would not be a &#8220;data transaction&#8221; and would not be covered by these Principles because the focus is on the functionality, not on the infor- mation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The fact that a set of digital data normally serves the purpose of deliver- ing certain functionalities does not ex- clude the possibility that the same set of data may also be used without refer- ence to those functionalities, in which case the data could be within the scope of these Principles.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Asset, resource, or tradeable commodity.</i> Information has always been subject to a variety of different contracts, in particular service con- tracts, and information rights have always been included in a wide range of legal regimes. Many of these issues fall outside the scope of these Princi- ples already because they are not about &#8220;digital&#8221; data, or because the informa- tion is not the focus of the transaction. However, there are cases in which the law provides that, e.g., particular in- formation must be given to a consum- er with particular digital means, or in which two parties agree in a contract that one party will disclose and publish all its conflicts of interest on the party&#8217;s website. In these cases, the legal rules are about digital data, and they are about the information aspect, but they still are not within the focus of these Principles. This is because these Prin- ciples are not primarily concerned with single pieces of information provided with the aim of immediately letting an- other party <i>know</i> something, but more about &#8220;bulk&#8221; or &#8220;serial&#8221; data, usually to be processed with the help of ma- chines, and used as an asset, resource, or tradeable commodity. Accordingly, supplying data within the meaning of these Principles is not so much about <i>doing</i> something, but more about <i>deliv- ering</i> something.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Issues addressed.</i> The devel- opment and identification of clear and certain principles that promote a data economy that is both efficient and fair is of fundamental importance to the development of that economy. Law governs the data economy in a wide variety of ways. These include the al- location of private rights with respect to transactions and the data to which the transactions relate, unfair compe- tition and antitrust law, privacy and data protection law, etc. These Princi- ples do not address that entire range of legal issues but, rather, focus on data contracts and data rights, and on the third-party aspects of such contracts and rights, as far as these are relevant in the context. In addition, these Prin- ciples provide some limited guidance as to multi-state issues with regard to data contracts and data rights, with- out providing a full set of choice-of-law rules.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Public bodies.</i> The control and processing of data by public bodies in the exercise of sovereign powers afford- ed to them by the applicable law is an extremely important topic that is, how- ever, beyond the boundaries of these Principles. These Principles therefore apply only to the extent that exercise of sovereign powers is not implicated (but even when these Principles could be applied to activities of public bodies, other, more specific, rules for dealings <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>with the government or government agencies may also apply).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. A public prosecutor col- lects data on a group of individu- als suspected of having committed cybercrimes. This activity is one in the exercise of sovereign powers, and suspects might not, e.g., rely on any of the Principles concerning data rights in co-generated data. However, if that authority enters into a contract with a private com- pany for data analytics services, these Principles might apply, be- cause the authority would not exer- cise any sovereign powers vis-&#224;-vis that company.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 3. Definitions</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent">References to a &#8220;public body&#8221; in these Principles include public admin- istrations and judges as well as civil law notaries and any kind of body inso- far as such bodies are engaging in the exercise of sovereign powers, be it di- rectly or by means of delegation to any other authorities, official professionals, or mixed bodies.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Even though these Principles do not apply to public bodies insofar as such bodies are engaging in the exercise of sovereign powers, these Principles may still apply to situations in which public bodies have collected data in the exercise of sovereign powers, but are now making that data available under schemes of open public sector data and the like, because sharing data in that manner is not in itself exercise of sov- ereign powers.</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. &#8220;Data&#8221; and &#8220;copy.&#8221;</i> These Prin- ciples are concerned only with data that is in a machine-readable format suitable for automated processing. In common parlance, such data is often referred to as &#8220;digital&#8221; data. However, these Principles are intended to cover also nondigital technologies (such as analog computing and, perhaps, quan- tum computing) when those technolo- gies enable comparable sorts of oper- ations to be performed on the data by automated means, i.e., when data is re- corded in other machine-readable for- mats suitable for automated process- ing. The intent, however, is to cover only data that is immediately suitable for automated processing by machines, not data that can be made suitable for such processing only by means of in- tervening technologies such as docu- ment scanners, or by similar technical means.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">6. Company N runs a news website. N collects a wide range of data concerning the search requests and browsing habits of its visitors and records this data electronically. This data falls within the definition of &#8220;data&#8221; in paragraph (1)(a) of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Thus, as used in these Principles, &#8220;data&#8221; would not cover the content of paper files even though that content can be made suitable for automated processing by way of a scanner and appropriate software. However, these Principles may also be appropriate for application by analogy to other record- ed information in some circumstances depending on, inter alia, the way the information is recorded and the man- ner in which it is to be used.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">7. Business B has main- tained many years of historical business records, which are re- corded on charts printed on paper. Because those charts are not im- mediately suitable for automated processing, these Principles do not address matters with regard to this sort of data. If, however, the charts were scanned and the resulting data was stored in machine-read- able format, these Principles would address matters with regard to the data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">8. Employee E of business B (unlawfully) &#8220;sells&#8221; B&#8217;s customer database to competitor C. However, due to specific information-technol- ogy security measures taken by B, it is easier for E to print the cus- tomer data on paper to deliver to C than to store the information on a digital medium or transmit it on- line to C. C will immediately scan the prints and convert the data into a digital format. In a setting like this, it would not seem appropriate to restrict the application of these Principles&#8212;such as the Principles on unauthorized access and what it means for a downstream recipient&#8212;to the phases when the customer data is in digital format. (Note that issues of criminal and other liabili- ty on the part of E are beyond the scope of these Principles).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The term &#8220;data&#8221; has multiple facets in common parlance. In fact, lawyers frequently talk past each other when using the term because they are re- ferring to different facets or concepts of &#8220;data.&#8221; Much confusion has been caused, in particular, by the vary- ing use of the terms &#8220;information&#8221; on the one hand and &#8220;data&#8221; on the other. These Principles use &#8220;data&#8221; to refer to information recorded in any form or medium, or to information in a state of transmission. In the case of digital data, this means that data is more than the binary electrical impulse stored or being transmitted, as it includes con- text and semantics. Context and semantics <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>are to be found in metadata, domain tables, etc.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The term &#8220;data&#8221; as defined in para- graph (1)(a) has more than one layer. Apart from the semantic layer, i.e., the layer that constitutes meaning, it can be understood as referring to the code as such (e.g., a characteristic binary string of &#8220;0s&#8221; and &#8220;1s&#8221;) or its physical manifestation on a particular medium. The former can be &#8220;coded,&#8221; &#8220;modified,&#8221; &#8220;decompiled,&#8221; etc., while the latter can be &#8220;stored,&#8221; &#8220;damaged,&#8221; &#8220;erased,&#8221; etc. In order to make this distinction more transparent, these Principles restrict the term &#8220;data&#8221; to the former, i.e., to the code as such (including context and semantics), while the physical manifes- tation on a medium is called a &#8220;copy.&#8221; A term that is often used with a sim- ilar meaning is &#8220;file,&#8221; which, however, seems also to have some associations that are not intended in this context.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">9. Business B collects data concerning B&#8217;s transactions with its customers, such as A, on a lo- cal hard disk drive, but there is a backup on a cloud server provided by C. The fact that A has bought a specified commodity from B on a specified date is the information. This information is recorded in the form of coded binary impulses, i.e., a characteristic string of &#8220;0s&#8221; and &#8220;1s,&#8221; which constitutes the data. This string can be found as a phys- ical manifestation both on B&#8217;s local hard disk drive and on C&#8217;s cloud server, so there exist two copies of the data (or even more, as there will be redundancies, and as there may be transitional copies in the cache of several devices).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The definition of the term &#8220;copy&#8221; ap- plies only as the term is used in these Principles. The definition here is not intended to resolve issues about the meaning of that term in other areas of the law, such as copyright law.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. &#8220;Processing data&#8221; and &#8220;access to data.&#8221;</i> A central term is &#8220;processing data,&#8221; which is defined to include any operation or set of operations that is performed on data. Thus &#8220;processing&#8221; includes operations such as organizing, structuring, storing, adapting or alter- ing, retrieving, transmitting, aligning or combining, restricting, erasing, or destroying data. Some of these opera- tions directly target the data as such, while others target the data only indi- rectly by targeting one or all existing copies. Defining the term generically to cover all of these operations is useful because, given the multitude of differ- ent ways in which data can be handled or used, it would be quite unwieldy to utilize different terminology for each of them, and, given the pace at which technology is developing, any terminol- ogy defined today may be incomplete or inappropriate tomorrow.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8220;Access to data&#8221; and processing of data are closely related notions. &#8220;Ac- cess&#8221; means being in a position to read the data and utilize it, in unspecified or specified ways, and with or without having control of that data. Processing of data usually requires access to the data. Access, conversely, often includes some kind of processing, but not nec- essarily so; merely reading data on a screen would amount to access but nor- mally not to processing, at least not in the narrower sense adopted by these Principles.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">10. Business B in Illustration no. 9 processes transactional data by structuring it, by analyzing it, and by way of many other opera- tions. Assuming B checks its trans- actions with A because A has filed a complaint (e.g., A claims never to have received a commodity for which he has been billed), retriev- ing transactional data from either the local drive or the cloud and making it visible on a screen on one <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of B&#8217;s devices amounts to process- ing (and a form of accessing). If B lets A look at the screen and read the information about A&#8217;s shopping history, access (on the part of A) is not accompanied by processing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. &#8220;Control of data,&#8221; &#8220;controller,&#8221; and &#8220;processor.&#8221;</i> Another central no- tion is that of &#8220;control of data.&#8221; &#8220;Con- trol of data&#8221; means being in a position to access the data and to determine the purposes and means of its processing, with or without having a right to do so. A &#8220;controller&#8221; means the natural or le- gal person, public authority, agency, or other body that, alone or jointly with others, has control of data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">11. Business B in Illustration no. 9 has its business data stored in cloud space on servers operated by C. B has the access credentials required to access and process the data as B deems appropriate. Even though B is not in &#8220;physical&#8221; control of the medium, B has, for the pur- poses of these Principles, control of the data and qualifies as a control- ler. C does not qualify as a control- ler insofar as there are features in place, be they of a technical or legal nature, that prevent C from deter- mining the processing of its custom- ers&#8217; data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Control does not necessarily mean being in a position to determine any possible kind of processing, e.g., a per- son may have access to a set of data and may be in a position to transfer it to someone else, but the data may be protected against modification. Also, &#8220;control&#8221; does not necessarily imply that the &#8220;controller&#8221; actually seeks access to the data or has the techni- cal capabilities that are necessary for actually accessing the data, as long as there are technical or legal features that would allow that party, without unreasonable effort, to access the data if the party wished to do so.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">12. Company N runs a news website. Use of the website by each visitor is, with the consent of N, closely monitored and recorded by data broker B (B paying a remuner- ation to N). While company N itself never takes an interest in collecting the visitors&#8217; data, and may not even have made any technical arrange- ments that would allow such collec- tion, it would not require unreason- able effort on N&#8217;s part to do so. N therefore has control of the visitors&#8217; data because it could access the data at any time if it so wished and because N determines the means and purposes of their processing by allowing B to harvest the data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Frequently, controllers enter into contractual arrangements with other persons about the processing of data to be carried out by those other persons, while keeping full control because processing is carried out on the con- trollers&#8217; behalf and according to their directions. Such other persons are pro- cessors, which means that, in some contexts&#8212;such as when it comes to the question of whose position primarily counts for rightfulness under Principle 28&#8212;it is the controller on whose behalf the processor is acting that counts. Be- ing a processor and processing data on behalf of a controller does not consti- tute control of data, so the roles of &#8220;pro- cessor&#8221; and of &#8220;controller&#8221; are normally mutually exclusive.</p>

P is not free to determine the means and, in particular, the purposes, for which the employee data is processed, but <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rather has to follow B&#8217;s directions. P is therefore not a controller, but a processor.</p>

A is not en- tirely free to determine the means and the purposes of processing B&#8217;s business data (e.g., A would not be allowed to disclose the data to B&#8217;s competitors), which could mean A is only a processor. However, A is not strictly subject to B&#8217;s directions ei- ther (e.g., B would not be allowed to direct A that A ignore certain data in order to paint a more optimistic picture of B&#8217;s business situation than is the reality). Therefore, it is more convincing to qualify A as controller, albeit as a controller that is subject to quite rigid restrictions when it comes to the purposes of the processing.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Employees or similar persons inte- grated in the controller&#8217;s organization- al framework and through whom the controller exercises control would not even be considered &#8220;processors.&#8221; When the controller is a legal entity, it can act only through its employees and other agents. Accordingly, when an employee is merely executing decisions made by the employer, any activity of the em- ployee with regard to data should be attributed exclusively to the employer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. &#8220;Co-generated data&#8221; and &#8220;derived data.&#8221;</i> &#8220;Co-generated data&#8221; means data to the generation of which a person has contributed, such as by being the subject of the information or the owner or operator of that subject, by pursuing a data-generating activi- ty or owning or operating a data-gen- erating device, or by producing or de- veloping a data-generating product or service. The term is used in the con- text of a particular type of data rights dealt with under Part III, Chapter B. The term is designed to indicate that, usually, a number of different persons have contributed to the generation of data, sometimes in very different roles. There may be situations in which only one person has contributed, at least in a meaningful way, to the generation of data. In those situations, the term &#8220;co-generated&#8221; may not be fully ap- propriate, but such a person would (<i>a fortiori</i>) have the rights under Part III, Chapter B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">While the term &#8220;co-generated data&#8221; refers to the parties who had a share in the generation of data, the term &#8220;de- rived data&#8221; refers to the fact that data develops in a dynamic way and is often generated on the basis of other data. Only an exact copy of a particular set of data would count as the &#8220;same&#8221; data, and even minor modifications would make a set of data a &#8220;different&#8221; set of data. In these Principles, &#8220;derived data&#8221; means any data that the relevant controller has generated by processing other data, i.e., by modifying, reducing, or extrapolating other data, or drawing inferences from other data. Given that there are many different ways in which data can be generated on the basis of other data, and that it is so difficult to draw a clear line and provide a coher- ent and complete set of classifications, these Principles adopt a broad notion of &#8220;derived.&#8221; In particular, they do not differentiate between &#8220;derived&#8221; and &#8220;inferred&#8221; data (i.e., data generated from other data with the help of exter- nal decision rules).</p>

When opening a user ac- count for an online game run by business G, users provide to G their name, email address, and credit card data, and G collects all sorts of other user data, such as about the user&#8217;s gaming behavior, typ- ing pace, etc. G then restructures the data, fills gaps in the data, and infers, with the help of algorithms and other knowledge not contained in the collected data, new information <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>from the user data, e.g., predic- tions about a party&#8217;s disposition to suffer from depression. The restruc- tured data, the completed data, and the data on potential depression all count as derived data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. &#8220;Data contracts,&#8221; &#8220;data rights,&#8221; and &#8220;data activities.&#8221;</i> These Principles are about data contracts and data rights, so these two terms are important for the proper understand- ing of these Principles. Both terms are to be understood broadly. A &#8220;data con- tract&#8221; is a contract the subject of which is data, either in the sense that data is the object of the transaction between two parties (i.e., the data is to be trans- ferred, disclosed, otherwise shared, etc.) or in the sense that one party promises to do something with regard to the data (i.e., the data is to be col- lected, processed, secured, etc.).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A &#8220;data right&#8221; means a right against a controller of certain data that is spe- cific to the nature of data as a non-ri- valrous resource and that arises from the way the data is generated (see Principles 18 to 23), or from the law for reasons of public interest (see Prin- ciples 24 to 27). It may, in particular, be a right to access to or porting of the data, to correction of the data or desis- tance from data use, or, very exception- ally, to an economic share in profits de- rived from using the data. Data rights are, in a certain way, the data-specific corollary to the ownership rights found in the tangible world or with regard to intellectual property.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8220;Data activities&#8221; is a term referred to in various places in these Principles, in particular in Part IV with regard to affected third parties. It means any activities by a person with respect to data, such as collection, acquisition, control, processing, and other activi- ties, including onward supply of data. The term is to be understood broadly, and as comprising activities of a factu- al nature (e.g., actually disclosing data to another party) as well as of a legal nature (e.g., making a contract with another party about access to data).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. &#8220;Supply,&#8221; &#8220;supplier,&#8221; and &#8220;re- cipient.&#8221;</i> It is in particular in data con- tracts that &#8220;supply&#8221; of data comes into play. The person who supplies data is the &#8220;supplier&#8221; and the other person is the &#8220;recipient.&#8221; &#8220;Supply&#8221; of data should be understood very broadly. In partic- ular, it is sufficient that the recipient gains access to the data, while it is not necessary that the recipient also gains control.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">16. Company N runs a news website offering any visitor ac- cess&#8212;without a paywall&#8212;to world news. N collects a wide range of data concerning the search requests and browsing habits of its visitors and &#8220;sells&#8221; and transfers the data to business B, which will use the data for profiling and scoring purposes. N and B agree that the data will be transferred to one of B&#8217;s servers. This transfer of the data to B quali- fies as &#8220;supply&#8221; of the visitor data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">17. Assume that company N in Illustration no. 16 does not collect the visitors&#8217; data itself but instead allows B to collect the data on N&#8217;s site. Despite the fact that N does not physically transmit any data to B, N still enables B to access the data, and to gain control of the data, and therefore qualifies as a &#8220;suppli- er&#8221; under these Principles.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. &#8220;Transfer,&#8221; &#8220;porting,&#8221; and &#8220;era- sure.&#8221;</i> While &#8220;supply&#8221; of data is a very broad and rather generic term, it is of- ten necessary to be more specific and to differentiate between different types of supply. An important type of sup- ply is &#8220;transfer&#8221; of data, in which the supplier puts the recipient in control of the data supplied (as contrasted with simple access). This normally implies that data is to be physically stored on <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a medium within the recipient&#8217;s sphere of control. Note that &#8220;transfer&#8221; does not imply that copies of the data are subse- quently erased by the supplier.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">18. The supply of data to B in both Illustration nos. 16 and 17 is a &#8220;transfer&#8221; as the data is supplied to B&#8217;s servers, which grants B full control of the data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">&#8220;Porting&#8221; data, which is frequently also referred to as &#8220;portability&#8221; of data, means requesting or otherwise initiat- ing the transfer of data controlled by another party to oneself or to a partic- ular third party. &#8220;Porting&#8221; and &#8220;trans- fer&#8221; are thus closely related, with the main difference being that of perspec- tive, as &#8220;porting&#8221; clearly takes the per- spective of the recipient exercising a right, while &#8220;transfer&#8221; is more neutral and describes an activity of the suppli- er. &#8220;Porting&#8221; tends to suggest to a cer- tain extent that the person requesting the transfer has a data right, i.e., that the data is, in one way or another, that person&#8217;s data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">19. Supply of the data collect- ed by N to B in Illustration no. 16 would be described as a &#8220;transfer&#8221; (and not as &#8220;porting&#8221;) because it is supplier N who collects the data and who then initiates transfer to B. However, if B is allowed to harvest data from the site in Illustration no. 17 and store the harvested data on B&#8217;s own medium, that would be de- scribed as &#8220;porting&#8221; rather than as &#8220;transfer,&#8221; because the active part is played by recipient B.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In particular contexts, &#8220;erasure&#8221; of data (one type of &#8220;processing&#8221; data) may become relevant. This means tak- ing reasonable steps to ensure that the data is permanently inaccessible or otherwise unreadable. What counts as &#8220;reasonable&#8221; depends on the individu- al circumstances and the purposes of erasure. It may, in an individual case, mean deleting all copies of the data that are accessible to the person eras- ing the data, and, as far as possible, deleting all copies accessible to third parties to whom that person has sup- plied the data. This is because, given the nature of data, there may exist an indefinite number of copies world- wide. Sometimes it may be sufficient to press a &#8220;delete&#8221; button even though, strictly speaking, the data would then still remain to be retrievable until the relevant storage space has been fully overwritten, and possibly even after that point. But normally, more sophis- ticated technical measures would be required.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>h. Notice.</i> A term that is used throughout these Principles is &#8220;notice.&#8221; &#8220;Notice&#8221; means having knowledge of a fact, but also covers situations in which, from all the facts and circum- stances of which a person has knowl- edge, the person can reasonably be expected to have known of the fact. It includes what is often referred to as &#8220;willful blindness.&#8221; If a person has no- tice of a fact (e.g., of the fact that pro- cessing data was wrongful), that often gives rise to an expectation that the person take action or desist from par- ticular actions accordingly, and if the person fails to react as can reasonably be expected, this often triggers adverse legal consequences.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>i. Definitions in other Princi- ples.</i> Paragraph (2) reminds us that the only terms defined in this Princi- ple are those used throughout these Principles. There are other terms that require a definition but that are used only in one Principle, or in one specif- ic context, and are thus better defined in the relevant context; in particular, the different types of data transactions identified in Part II.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>j. References to &#8220;person,&#8221; &#8220;opera- tion,&#8221; or &#8220;activity.&#8221;</i> Paragraph (3) clari- fies that reference to &#8220;person&#8221; includes any natural or legal person, or group <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of persons. What may be more import- ant is that reference to any &#8220;operation&#8221; or &#8220;activity&#8221; includes operations and activities carried out by human auxil- iaries and, increasingly, by machines. Machines include any artificial intelli- gence, i.e., it is irrelevant for the appli- cation of these Principles whether, e.g., a data contract was concluded by way of two individuals exchanging offer and acceptance or whether offer and accep- tance were articulated and received by &#8220;autonomous&#8221; software agents.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When a contract is concluded by machines, some concepts used in these Principles may require adaptation. For example, these Principles frequently refer to a party having &#8220;notice&#8221; of a fact. When there is not a human but a machine that carries out relevant oper- ations or activities, the concept of &#8220;no- tice&#8221; may have to be adapted.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">20. A contract for the transfer of particular data is made with the help of two different autonomous software agents operated by supplier S and recipient R. S had received the data from third party T under another contract, and under that contract S had promised not to for- ward or disclose the data to any oth- er person. According to Principle 34, T may have remedies against R if R had &#8220;knowledge&#8221; or could be expect- ed to have knowledge of S&#8217;s breach vis-&#224;-vis T and further conditions are met. If R used an autonomous software agent and that agent was unable to process information as to restrictions of that kind, R cannot hide behind the agent and claim to have acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Equally, any reference to intent or to standards of care, due diligence, etc. may have to be understood in a way that is suitable for machine-to-ma- chine dealings. However, this is not in any way different from machine-to-ma- chine dealings other than in the con- text of data rights and transactions, which is why these Principles do not spell out in detail how general concepts are to be adapted.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 4. Remedies</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Remedies with respect to data contracts and data rights, includ- ing with respect to any protection of third parties in the context of data activities, should generally be determined by the applicable law.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When these Principles or applicable law mandate the return or surrender of data by a party (the defendant) to another party (the claim- ant), the defendant should be able to satisfy the obligation to return or surrender the data by, instead, erasing all of the defendant&#8217;s copies of the data. If the claimant does not have a copy of the data, the defendant must put the claimant in control of the data before erasing it.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Remedies.</i> These Principles do not generally address remedial mat- ters, leaving that to applicable law. Often, applicable law assesses money damages or monetary restitution as the remedy. However, there are also a number of cases in which the applicable law may require specific performance, and some jurisdictions, in particular in continental Europe, may have a gener- al tendency toward preferring specific performance over money damages.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Return as part of a remedy.</i> Sometimes, applicable rules or prin- ciples require the return of an item, including data, that was delivered to a party&#8212;for example, when data has been supplied by mistake, or when a contract was avoided or canceled after <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>data was already supplied. Return is an elusive concept for data of which there can be many copies. Hence, para- graph (2) reflects the unique character of data and adjusts the duty to return accordingly. It provides that data may be &#8220;returned&#8221; by erasing all copies of the data that the recipient may still have under its control. If the supplier does not have a copy, e.g., because the parties had agreed that the recipient would have exclusive control and the supplier had undertaken to erase all of its copies, the recipient must put the supplier in control of a copy again be- fore erasing its copies.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">21. Employees of a depart- ment of company S transmit indus- trial data to company R in the erro- neous belief that a contract between S and R about the supply of the data has been concluded. (Actually, nego- tiations failed at the last moment.) If applicable law would otherwise require R to return the mistakenly supplied data, R may instead erase all copies of the data of which it has control. If S&#8217;s employees erased all of S&#8217;s copies of the data&#8212;perhaps because that was a term of the (failed) contract&#8212;R must put S in control of the data before erasing it.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">There may be situations in which, in light of the circumstances mandating the return, and the legitimate interests of the claimant as well as any protected third party, it may be more reasonable to make an allowance in money to be paid to the claimant instead of return by erasure. Determining whether this is the case requires a careful analysis of the individual circumstances, which is why these Principles do not take a general stance on this matter. For a specific situation in which these Princi- ples do provide guidance in this regard, see, however, Principle 36(2).</p>
<p class="head2"><b>PART II <br/><br/>DATA CONTRACTS</b></p>
<p class="head3"><b>CHAPTER A <br/>RULES AND PRINCIPLES GOVERNING DATA CONTRACTS</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 5. Application of these Principles to Data Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Data contracts under Part II should be governed, in the following or- der of priority, by:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) rules of law that cannot be derogated from by agreement;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the agreement of the parties;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) any rules of law other than those referred to in subparagraph</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) that have been developed for application to data transactions of the relevant kind;</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) the terms included in the contracts by operation of Principles 7 to 15;</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) application by analogy of default rules and principles of law that are not directly applicable to data transactions of the relevant kind but that would govern analogous transactions; and</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(f) general principles of law.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Hierarchy of sources</i>. This Principle provides a general hierarchy for determining the rules governing data contracts.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">At the top of that hierarchy are mandatory rules of applicable law that cannot be varied by agreement. Such mandatory rules differ from jurisdic- tion to jurisdiction. Examples of such rules include doctrines of unconscio- nability or unfairness control, obliga- tions of good faith and fair dealing that cannot be disclaimed, prohibitions on excessively large liquidated damages, and also certain mandatory require- ments to be included in contracts be- tween controllers and processors under the law of some jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Next in priority is the agreement of the parties. This is because principles of party autonomy present in most legal systems give parties to a contract wide leeway to determine the terms of their relationship. Of course, what counts as the &#8220;agreement of the parties&#8221; is part- ly an issue of fact and partly the result of applying the rules of the applicable legal system as to what constitutes an agreement and how binding agree- ments are formed, as well as rules that determine which communications are to be treated as part of an agreement when varying communications&#8212;oral as well as written or electronic&#8212;have been exchanged.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent">Many data transactions are the subject of extensive negotiations and careful contract drafting, while others are en- tered into with significantly less indi- vidualized attention. Disputes about the rights and obligations of parties do not typically arise when the subject of the dispute is covered by express agree- ment of the parties. Rather, they arise more often with respect to issues not covered in that agreement. All agree- ments are inevitably incomplete, with the result that, in the event of dispute, law is called upon to fill the gaps. In some cases, the issue may be one that was simply not addressed by the par- ties; in other cases, the parties may have thought the resolution was im- plicit in their agreement. For issues of this sort that arise with some frequen- cy, contract law often deals with this phenomenon by providing for terms that are &#8220;automatically&#8221; included in a contract unless derogated from by agreement of the parties. Such terms are usually referred to as &#8220;default&#8221; terms or &#8220;implied&#8221; terms. Subpara- graphs (c) to (e) of this Principle set out, in order of priority, how law fills the gaps in parties&#8217; agreements in de- termining their rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, subparagraph (c) defers to contract law rules of the relevant ju- risdiction insofar as they have been developed for application to data trans- actions of the relevant kind. Some states may have such data-specific rules, while others may not. Next, sub- paragraph (d) refers to Principles 7 through 15, which develop recommend- ed default rules for nine types of data transactions. Finally, subparagraph (e) provides for the application of default rules and principles that apply to anal- ogous transactions. As it is often diffi- cult to identify contract law principles to govern a contract by analogy, Prin- ciples 7 through 15 also supply a list of factors a court should consider when deciding whether to adopt rules by analogy in the context of the particular types of data transactions addressed in those Principles. In applying rules by analogy under subparagraph (e), terms in those rules should be adjusted to the context of data transactions. So, for ex- ample, references to ownership must sometimes be replaced by references to control of the data, references to use or the like must sometimes be replaced by references to access to data, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>references to delivery or the like must sometimes be replaced by references to the provision of control or access. For matters not addressed in subpara- graphs (c) to (e), subparagraph (f) of this Principle ultimately defers to gen- eral principles of law to fill remaining gaps. These general principles will, in the first place, be general principles of contract law, but could equally be gen- eral principles of other bodies of law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 6. Interpretation and Application of Contract Law</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In interpreting and applying rules and principles of contract law, the following factors, among others, should be considered:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the fact that data is a combination of (i) physical manifesta- tions on a medium or in a state of being transmitted, and (ii) informa- tion recorded;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the nature of data as a resource of which there may be mul- tiple copies and which can be used in parallel by various parties for a multitude of different purposes;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the fact that data is usually derived from other data, and that the original data set and a multitude of derived data sets that resem- ble the original data set to a greater or lesser extent may coexist;</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) the fact that, while the physical location of data storage may change quickly and easily, data is normally utilized by way of remote access, and the physical location of data storage is typically of little importance; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) the high significance of cumulative effects and effects of scale.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. General observations.</i> The subject of data contracts is different, in many ways, from the subject of many other contracts. Because of those dif- ferences between the subject of data contracts and that of many other con- tracts, application of general principles of contract law, often designed for those other contexts, should be sensitive to those differences. In some cases, this will involve interpretation of general principles in a manner that is consis- tent with the context in which they are to be applied. In other cases, these dif- ferences will guide and constrain anal- ogies to principles of law that govern different subjects.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This Principle comes into play at several of the levels within the hier- archy of rules established in Principle</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">5. When there are mandatory rules of law, i.e., rules of law that cannot be derogated from by agreement, within the meaning of Principle 5(a), those mandatory rules may have been draft- ed with traditional transactions about traditional resources (such as goods or rights) in mind. When they need to be applied to a data contract, the specifici- ties of data must be taken into account. Even more, when default rules and principles of law that are not directly applicable to data transactions of the relevant kind are applied by analogy within the meaning of Principle 5(e), those rules and principles normally must be adapted to fit in the data con- text. The same holds true for general principles of law, including contract law, within the meaning of Principle 5(f).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Factors to be considered.</i> This Principle lists some factors that should <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>be considered when applying contract law that was not drafted with data transactions in mind. An important special feature of data is the fact that data is a combination of binary impuls- es that may be physically manifest on a medium or be transmitted, and the in- formation recorded in those binary im- pulses. This means that, e.g., the act of supplying data is closer to &#8220;delivering&#8221; but certainly has a &#8220;doing&#8221; element, and, accordingly, a contract to supply data is somewhat in between a sales contract and a service contract.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">22. If A sells a machine to B, that transaction can be described as being about delivering something, and if A promises to provide legal advice to B, that is clearly a service. However, if A shares data with B, that is somewhat in between de- livering something to B (i.e., the binary impulses, by way of trans- mission) and doing something for B (i.e., triggering a change in the state of B&#8217;s storage device), which makes it difficult, for instance, to seek proper analogies.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Another important feature that makes data different from almost all other resources is its non-rivalrous nature, i.e., the fact that there may be multiple copies of one and the same set of data, which can be used in parallel by various parties for a multitude of different purposes.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">23. If A sells a machine to B, A will no longer have the machine, but if A sells data to B, both A and B can have and use the data, and the multiplication of the data does not in any way reduce its practi- cal utility (without prejudice to the fact that the market value of data may decrease rapidly with increas- ing numbers of persons having the data). This may affect the way in which a court would apply rules and doctrines such as on the pass- ing of risk, because if data is lost or destroyed while being transmitted from the supplier to the recipient, the supplier is able to transmit an- other copy at no or only negligible cost.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A similar feature of data is that data can be changed within fractions of a second, and that almost all data is derived from other data, with the changed or derived set of data often ex- isting in parallel with all the previous versions, partly coinciding with previ- ous versions, and partly not.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">24. If A rents a cow to B, it is clear that, when the contract term comes to an end, B must return the cow, and, if the cow has meanwhile given birth to a calf, possibly the calf (depending on the applicable contract and property law). If A gives access to data to B for a partic- ular access period, the law will not only have to mandate that B erase any copies of the data B may have retained (on which, see subpara- graph (b) of this Principle as well as Principle 4(2)), but will also have to decide which data sets that have, in one way or another, been derived from A&#8217;s data set, are included in the duty to return.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Another characteristic feature of data is the fact that, while the physi- cal location of data storage may change within fractions of a second, the data is normally utilized by way of remote ac- cess, and the storage location is of little relevance.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">25. If A sells a machine to B, contract law may provide for rules on the place of performance, e.g., the default rule might be that the place of performance is the place of <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>establishment of seller A, but that it is the establishment of C if the ma- chine is currently in the possession of C. However, if A supplies data to B, it may not necessarily make sense to identify the place of perfor- mance according to the same rules, in particular as, with cloud-based storage, the location of data may no longer play any meaningful role. In- deed, the concept of a &#8220;place&#8221; of per- formance may have little meaning in this context.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Finally, it is the unusually high sig- nificance of cumulative effects and ef- fects of scale that make data different from other resources, in that the value of data depends largely on which other data they can be combined with, who has access to the data, and similar fac- tors.</p>

<p class="head4"><b>Principle 7. Contracts for the Transfer of Data</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A contract for the transfer of data is a transaction under which the supplier undertakes to put the recipient in control of particular data by transferring the data to a medium within the recipient&#8217;s control, or by delivering to the recipient a medium on which the data is stored.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority pursuant to Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a contract for the transfer of data:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) With regard to the manner in which the supplier is to perform its undertaking described in paragraph (1), the data should be trans- ferred in accordance with the recipient&#8217;s directions, unless the mode of transfer indicated is unreasonable (e.g., in light of data security concerns), in which case the supplier should promptly notify the re- cipient of those concerns so that the recipient may substitute different directions for transfer.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) With regard to the characteristics of the data supplied, includ- ing with regard to nature, quantity, accuracy, currentness, integrity, granularity, and formats, as well as with regard to the inclusion of metadata, domain tables, and other specifications required for data utilization, and to frequency of supply and any updates:</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) the supplied data must conform to any material descrip- tions or representations concerning the data made or adopted by the supplier, and to any samples or models provided;</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) if the supplier has notice of the recipient&#8217;s particular pur- pose for obtaining the data, and that the recipient is relying on the supplier&#8217;s skill or judgment in selecting the supplied data, the sup- plied data must be fit for the recipient&#8217;s particular purpose; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) if the supplier is in the business of supplying data of the sort that is the subject of the contract or otherwise holds itself out as having expertise with respect to data of that sort, the supplied <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>data must be of a quality that would reasonably be expected in a transaction of the relevant kind.</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) With regard to the control of, and other data activities with regard to, the supplied data:</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) if the supplied data is protected by intellectual property law or a similar regime, the supplier must place the recipient in the position of having a legal right, effective against third parties, that is sufficient to result in the recipient&#8217;s control of the data and the right to engage in such other data activities that the controller had notice that the recipient could reasonably expect to engage in; if putting the recipient in that position requires additional steps to be taken by the supplier, such as execution or recordation of a required document, the supplier must take those additional steps;</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) the supplier must place the recipient in a position, at the time the data is supplied, of being able rightfully to exercise control over the data and rightfully to engage in other data activities that the controller had notice that the recipient could reasonably expect to engage in; if, after the data has been supplied, the recipient&#8217;s control of the data or other data activities become wrongful, this does not of itself give rise to a claim by the recipient against the supplier;</p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) the supplier must cooperate, to the extent reasonably nec- essary, in actions that may be required to comply with legal require- ments with respect to control of the data or other data activities that the controller had notice that the recipient could reasonably expect to engage in; in addition, the supplier must provide to the recipient information about any legal requirements with respect to any such data activities of which the supplier has notice and of which the recipient cannot be expected to be aware;</p>
<p class="indent2">(iv) the recipient may utilize the data and any derived data, including by onward supply to others, for any lawful purpose and in any way that does not infringe the rights of the supplier or third parties, and that does not violate any obligations the supplier has vis-&#224;-vis third parties, provided the recipient had notice of these obligations at the time the contract for the transfer of data was concluded;</p>
<p class="indent2">(v) as between the parties, new intellectual property rights or similar rights created by the recipient with the use of the supplied data belong to the recipient; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(vi) the supplier may retain a copy of the data and may contin- ue using the data, including by supplying it to third parties.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining which rules and principles should apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for the transfer of data, consideration should be given in particular to:</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) whether the contract provides for the recipient to be in control of the data for an unlimited period of time or for a limited period of time; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) whether the contract is for a single supply of data, repeated supply, or continuous supply over a period of time.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> This Principle is the first of a series of Principles setting out default provisions for contracts con- cerning different types of data transac- tions. Under this Principle, A contract for the transfer of data is a transaction under which the supplier undertakes to supply particular data to a recipient, and, in doing so, to put the recipient in control of that data by transferring the data to a medium within the recipient&#8217;s control or by delivering to the recipient a medium on which the data is stored. This type of contract may involve data of any kind, whether raw or derived, and whether or not protected by intel- lectual property law or a similar re- gime.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">26. Supplier S operates an on- line shop and holds large amounts of customer data. S promises to re- cipient R to supply specified types of data (name, email address, goods bought, search requests made) re- garding the shopping behavior of a specified number (20,000) of cus- tomers from specified regions (the United States and the European Union) that has accumulated over a specified period (24 months) and to transfer the data to a medium with- in R&#8217;s control. The purpose of this deal is to enable R to engage in tar- geted advertising campaigns. This would be a contract for the transfer of data under this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">A medium within the recipient&#8217;s control may be, for example, the re- cipient&#8217;s server. It may also be a cloud space to which the supplier gives the recipient the access credentials if the intention is to allow the recipient to download the data from the cloud space onto a medium within the recipi- ent&#8217;s control, or if the cloud space is in- tended to remain within the recipient&#8217;s control. The supplier may also deliver a storage device on which the data is stored.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms as to the mode of supply.</i> The parties to a contract for the transfer of data will typically agree how the data should be supplied to the recipient. If the contract is silent re- garding the mode of supply of the data, paragraph (2)(a) provides relevant default terms. The default terms pro- vide that the data is to be transferred in accordance with the recipient&#8217;s di- rections. The recipient will typically choose to have the data transferred directly to a medium controlled by the recipient, or to have the data provided on a medium to which the recipient has or is given access (in accordance with Article 8(2)(a)(i)) and from which the recipient may port the data to a medi- um of the recipient&#8217;s choice. However, the mode of transfer indicated by the recipient need not be accepted by the supplier if it is unreasonable, such as, for example, in case of data security concerns or when the transfer would be very costly.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">27. Assume that, in the trans- action in Illustration no. 26, recipi- ent R directs supplier S to transfer the customer-related data to par- ticular cloud space, but this cloud space is insecure, and thus not a reasonable mode of transfer. S is not obligated to transfer the data to the insecure cloud space. (This protects <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>S from the possibility that S itself might be in breach of contrac- tual and statutory duties if custom- er data is transferred to insecure storage space.)</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When the mode of transfer is unrea- sonable, the supplier should promptly notify the recipient of those concerns so that the recipient may indicate a sub- stitute.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Default terms as to the charac- teristics of the data.</i> When the default terms relate to characteristics of the data that is the subject of the transac- tion, those terms are usually referred to as &#8220;warranties.&#8221; Characteristics of data have many facets, some of the most important being: nature (includ- ing whether the data are personal data or nonpersonal data according to the applicable law), accurateness, currentness, integrity, granularity, and formats, as well as the inclusion of metadata, domain tables, and oth- er specifications (such as ontologies) required for data utilization, and fre- quency of supply and any updates. The warranty terms set out in this Princi- ple are analogous to warranty terms included as default terms in contracts for the sale of goods.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, in some cases, even though the parties have not expressly stated in the contract the nature, quantity, and quality of the data, descriptions or representations concerning the data have been made or adopted by the sup- plier. When these descriptions or rep- resentations are part of the basis of the bargain, this Principle incorporates them into the contract. In those cases, it is appropriate for the supplier to be bound by those descriptions or repre- sentations as though they were ex- pressly stated in the agreement of the parties. The same holds true if the sup- plier has provided the recipient with samples (such as a sample dataset) or models (such as the structure in which the information will be presented).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">28. Assume that, in the ne- gotiation of the transaction in Il- lustration no. 26, supplier S states that the data sets have been up- dated within the last six months. Therefore, the contract includes a requirement that the data has, in fact, been updated within that peri- od.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">29. If, during the negotiation of the transaction in Illustration no. 26, supplier S provides recipient R with sample datasets of 100 typical customers, and in these datasets the names are complete and all of the fields, even the nonmandatory fields, are filled in, the contract in- cludes a term that all datasets are as complete as the sample.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, if the supplier has notice of the recipient&#8217;s particular purpose for obtaining the data and that the re- cipient is relying on the supplier&#8217;s skill or judgment in selecting the supplied data, the supplied data must be fit for the recipient&#8217;s particular purpose. While this is probably an exceptional situation in the data world, the selec- tion and furnishing of data by the sup- plier in such circumstances could be seen as an implicit statement by the supplier that the data is fit for the re- cipient&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">30. Assume that, in a situa- tion of the kind described in Illus- tration no. 26, recipient R develops a new smart service that functions in conjunction with fitness bracelets from a defined range of manufac- turers. R is interested in having ac- cess to customers who have bought such bracelets and might thus be interested in R&#8217;s new service. R ap- proaches supplier S, disclosing to S this purpose and indicating that it is relying on S in selecting appropri- ate data sets. S then declares that <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>S has appropriate datasets for R, and the two enter into a contract for the transfer of customer data. It is a term of the contract that the data- sets supplied are fit for the purpose disclosed by R.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, according to paragraph (2) (b)(iii) a default term that the supplied data must be of a quality that would reasonably be expected in a transac- tion of the relevant kind becomes part of the contract if &#8220;the supplier is in the business of supplying data of the sort that is the subject of the contract or otherwise holds itself out as having expertise with respect to data of that sort.&#8221; This condition to the presence of the default term is included because it is fair to require the supplier to stand behind the quality of data in situations in which the market has that expec- tation in light of the characteristics of the supplier. This is not a mandatory term, but the burden is on a supplier that does not want to have this respon- sibility for the quality of the data to ne- gate the default term in the contract. This arrangement of responsibilities is similar to responsibilities for the quality of goods in many legal systems. One context is when the supplier is a business that collects large amounts of data as part of its business, such as a social network or a search engine pro- vider. Another context occurs when a company that manufactures goods or provides services accumulates a sub- stantial amount of data as part of its operations and goes into the separate business of selling that data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">31. Shoe manufacturer S man- ufactures custom-made shoes for customers who supply foot measure- ments via a specially designed app. Accordingly, S has accumulated a large amount of data about foot siz- es that is not available elsewhere. S concludes that there is a market for this sort of data among other shoe manufacturers, suppliers of ortho- pedic equipment, etc., and markets the foot-size data to companies in those industries. There is so much demand for this data that S makes significant profits every year sup- plying it. S is &#8220;in the business of supplying data of the sort that is the subject of the contract.&#8221; Accord- ingly, the contracts for the transfer of data include the default term in paragraph (2)(b)(iii) of this Princi- ple.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">32. If, in a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, supplier S has made trade in customer data part of its business and regularly engages in this to generate additional income, S can be expected to make sure the data is of the quality that is normal in transactions of the relevant kind. For example, when, in the relevant industry and under the relevant circumstances, the normal expec- tation would be that not more than about 15 percent of customer email addresses will fail at the point in time when the data is transferred, the contract includes a term that the email addresses will conform to that expectation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">33. If, conversely, in a situ- ation of the kind described in Il- lustration no. 26, supplier S sim- ply runs an online shop and has just accumulated customer data for S&#8217;s own purposes, but then is approached by R as to whether S might be prepared to sell the cus- tomer data (which S would initially not have planned, but is happy to do in order to generate additional income), the term that the email addresses will conform to the expec- tations in the relevant industry is not included in the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Default terms with regard to control of, and other data activities with regard to, the supplied data.</i> A <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>third group of default terms concerns control and use of the supplied data by the recipient.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, when the supplied data is protected under intellectual property law or a similar regime (such as EU investment protection for databases), the supply of that data would have little value if it did not include an ap- propriate legal right to use that data. The parties&#8217; intention is normally fo- cused on the granting or assignment of a legal right that allows the grantee or assignee to have rightful control of that particular set of data, and that al- lows the recipient to engage in all data activities that the controller had notice that the recipient could reasonably expect to engage in, and that is effec- tive vis-&#224;-vis the rightholder and other third parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">This Principle does not address whether and to what extent the supply of copyright-protected data should be characterized as a license contract or as a sale; this Principle applies under ei- ther characterization. The nature and extent of the right to be provided (e.g., whether it is a license for limited or for unlimited time, on how many servers the data may be stored and run, how many people may use the data at the same time), if not specified by the par- ties, should be broad enough to enable the use contemplated by the contract. If the right provided is insufficient for such use, the supplier&#8217;s actions fall short of what this term requires and the supplier is liable for breach. Because some domestic intellectual property regimes require licenses to be memorialized in a writing or record, or require recordation of the writing or re- cord (or a reference to it), paragraph (2) (c)(i) also addresses that situation.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">34. The customer data that supplier S promises to transfer to recipient R in a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26 in- cludes some photographic material that customers have uploaded to share their experience with other customers, and that is protected by intellectual property law. Even if not expressly agreed, the contract includes a term according to which S must make sure R gets a license that allows R to do at least what R intends to do with the data when the contract is concluded, i.e., ana- lyze the data for purposes of target- ed advertising.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Even when data is not protected by intellectual property law, the use- fulness of data to the recipient would be undermined if the recipient did not obtain rightful control over the data at the time it is supplied, or could not engage in other data activities that the controller had notice that the recipient could reasonably expect to engage in. Thus, paragraph (2)(c)(ii) states, as a default term, that the recipient must obtain such control. The supplier must therefore ensure that, for example, there are no legal barriers that would prevent the recipient from rightfully gaining control. Legal barriers could be barriers stemming, e.g., from data privacy/data protection law, from intel- lectual property law, or from a similar regime such as trade secrets law. The methods by which the supplier ensures the absence of legal barriers will de- pend on the individual circumstances. They could, e.g., include the seeking of valid consent or other forms of waiver of rights, or technical measures such as anonymization of data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">35. Assume that, in a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, the agreement between sup- plier S and recipient R is silent as to whether S is responsible for en- suring that the customers, who are protected by a data privacy regime, have given all necessary consents to transfer of control of the data to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>R. S supplies the data, but 5,000 of the customers have not given their consent to the transfer of control of the data, with the result that, under the applicable data privacy regime, control of the data by R would be wrongful. S has violated its obli- gation under paragraph (2)(c)(i) to enable the recipient rightfully to exercise control over the data at the time it is supplied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, subsequent facts rendering control or other data activities by the recipient wrongful (and possibly trig- gering a duty of the supplier to inform the recipient under Principle 32(2)), do not, as such, give rise to a claim by the recipient against the supplier.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">36. Same facts as Illustration no. 35, except that, at the time of transfer, the customers all gave consent to the transfer of control of the data. After the data is supplied, however, 5,000 customers protected by a data privacy regime withdraw their consent to the transfer, with the result that, under the applica- ble data privacy regime, any future control or processing of these data by R would be wrongful. S has not violated its obligation under para- graph (2)(c)(i) to enable the recip- ient rightfully to exercise control over the data at the time it is sup- plied.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, there may be other legal re- quirements with respect to control and use of the data. Paragraph (2)(c)(iii) provides, as a default term, important obligations of the supplier with respect to such requirements. In particular, the supplier is obliged to provide the sort of support that can reasonably be expected in order to comply with legal requirements governing control and use of the data. In addition, although a recipient can be expected to be aware of the sort of legal requirements that apply to the control and use of data generally, paragraph (2)(c)(iii) includes a default term requiring the supplier to disclose any legal requirements that the recipient cannot be expected to be aware of, as far as the supplier has no- tice of them, and provide support to the recipient in complying with them.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">37. In a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, recipient R can be expected to be sufficiently aware of the general fact that both customers from the United States (e.g., residents of Cal- ifornia) and customers from the Eu- ropean Union may be protected by data privacy regimes because this is a fact that should be known to any- one engaging in a data transaction. However, if it is not evident that some of the customer data qualifies as health data and is therefore sub- ject to a much stricter regime, and R (who is not a very sophisticated recipient) cannot be expected to be aware of this stricter regime, S is under an obligation to inform R of this fact if S has notice.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fourth, unless the parties have agreed to the contrary, it is appropri- ate to treat the contract as one that does not place any limits on how the recipient may utilize the data (includ- ing by passing it on), so a default rule to that effect is included. Thus, among the policy choices for default rules rec- ommended by these Principles is that data supplied may be used by the recip- ient for any lawful purpose that does not infringe the rights of the supplier or of third parties, including any obli- gations the supplier has vis-&#224;-vis third parties provided the recipient had no- tice of these obligations. With regard to data that is not protected by intellectu- al property law, these Principles thus take a &#8220;sales&#8221; approach (i.e., freedom of the recipient is the default position, and limitations must be agreed upon), <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and not a &#8220;license&#8221; approach (which would mean that, as a default rule, the recipient may engage only in the data activities agreed upon).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">38. As a default position, R would, in a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, be allowed to utilize the customer data for any purpose R deems fit as long as this utilization does not infringe any rights of S or of third parties, including in particular the custom- ers under an applicable data pri- vacy regime. So, provided the data privacy law so allows, and there are no other specific restrictions on the use of the data (such as a duty of S of which R had notice when the contract was concluded), R would be free to change its mind and no longer (just) engage in targeted ad- vertising, but instead (also) use the data for developing a new online reputation system.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In practice, however, it is quite com- mon that parties supply data under a contract labeled a &#8220;license&#8221; even if they have really concluded a contract for the transfer of data, and specify in that &#8220;li- cense&#8221; the conditions under which the supplied data may be used. If the data is not protected by intellectual proper- ty law, or no longer protected due to ex- haustion (first sale doctrine), this is a contract covered by this Principle with- out regard to how the parties label it. If the parties make further agreements about the purposes for which the recip- ient may or may not process the data, about the number of people to whom the data may be disclosed, or about the duration of use by the recipient, they create, by virtue of freedom of contract, independent contractual obligations of the recipient to refrain from particular operations.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">39. If the parties in a situation of the kind in Illustration no. 26 so wish, they may describe, in some detail, the types of data use recip- ient R may or may not engage in. In particular, they may agree that R must not compete with S on par- ticular markets, or pass the data on to third parties. R is bound by this contractual restriction on data utili- zation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In this context, it is important to highlight the connection between Prin- ciples 7 through 15 and Principles 32 through 34 inasmuch as the latter deal with the supplier&#8217;s obligation to pass on certain restrictions and obligations to the recipient and to alert the recip- ient, (e.g., if subsequent events occur that are relevant for the recipient&#8217;s legal position). In particular, Principle 32(1) obliges the supplier to impose particular contractual duties and re- strictions on the recipient to the extent that these duties and restrictions must be complied with for the benefit of a protected party within the meaning of Part IV, Chapter A.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fifth, the question of allocation of intellectual property rights created with supplied data is something parties to a transaction should normally agree on in advance, inasmuch as that allo- cation may have important economic effects. Under this Principle, there is a default term that these new intellectu- al property rights belong to the recip- ient. As with all default terms, this is subject to mandatory legal rules that cannot be derogated from by contract, and to agreement between the parties to the transaction. For example, appli- cable law might provide that new intel- lectual property rights are vested in a third party such as in an employee of the recipient.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">40. Assume that in a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, R would indeed use the data for developing a new online reputa- tion system, which in itself would be protected by copyright. As a de- fault position, S would not hold any rights in that system, and all in- tellectual property rights would be vested in R. This is, however, just as between the parties, so if the law provides that, really, the intellectu- al property rights should be vested in independent coder C, this is to be respected.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sixth and finally, a contract for the transfer of data is not usually intended to deprive the supplier of the continu- ing right to use that data. Accordingly, paragraph (2)(c)(vi) provides a default rule to the effect that the supplier may retain a copy of the data and may con- tinue using it, including by supplying it to third parties, i.e., any utilization rights of the recipient are normally nonexclusive.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration: Principle 7</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">41. In a situation of the kind described in Illustration no. 26, no one would expect supplier S to de- lete all of its customer data after having transferred them to recipi- ent R. But there may be scenarios in which this is less self-evident, e.g., when the data relate to a type of goods S wishes to stop offering on the market, while R wants to invest in selling precisely this type of goods. Still, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, S would not be required to delete the data after the transfer.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Application of other law by analogy.</i> Principle 5 provides that de- fault rules and principles that are not directly applicable to the transaction at hand but that would govern a type of transaction akin to the transaction at hand may be applied to that transac- tion by analogy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Since a contract for the transfer of data under which the recipient may use the data for an unlimited period of time will very often have many import- ant characteristics of a sale, inasmuch as unlimited use transfers the econom- ic value of the data to the recipient, the closest analogy may often be to the law of sale of goods, unless the relevant ju- risdiction provides for specific rules on the supply of digital content. If, how- ever, the terms of the contract provide that the recipient may use the data only for a limited period of time (wheth- er or not enforced by the data being self-destructing and readable only for a limited period of time), the more appro- priate analogy may sometimes be the law of lease contracts, or similar bodies of the law. Also, different sets of legal rules may apply depending on whether the contract is for a one-time exchange or for repeated or continuous supply.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The list in paragraph (3) of crite- ria to take into account when deciding which rules and principles to apply by analogy is not exhaustive. Other cri- teria that may be useful, depending on the circumstances, include the na- ture of the data and of any third-par- ty rights in the data, and whether the supplier also promises, under the same contract, to customize the data sets that are to be supplied, which may rec- ommend an analogy to the law of ser- vices contracts.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 8. Contracts for Simple Access to Data</b></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract for simple access to data is one under which the sup- plier undertakes to provide to the recipient access to particular data on a medium within the supplier&#8217;s control and which is not a contract for the transfer of data under Principle 7. This includes contracts in which the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>supplier, in addition to enabling the recipient to read the data, under- takes to put the recipient in a position to process the data on the medium within the supplier&#8217;s control, or port data.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a contract for simple access to data:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) With regard to the mode of the recipient&#8217;s access to the data:</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) the supplier must provide the recipient with the neces- sary access credentials and remove any technical barriers to access whose removal could reasonably be expected in a transaction of the relevant kind;</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) the supplier must make the data accessible in a structured and machine-readable format of a sort that can reasonably be ex- pected in a transaction of the relevant kind;</p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) the supplier must enable the data to be accessed remotely by the recipient unless this is unreasonable in light of data security concerns;</p>
<p class="indent2">(iv) the recipient may process the data to which the recipient is given access only for purposes consistent with any purposes agreed in the contract;</p>
<p class="indent2">(v) the recipient may port data to which the recipient is given access in the contract only when the porting of such data can rea- sonably be expected in a transaction of the relevant kind, and may port data derived from the recipient&#8217;s processing activities carried out in accordance with the contract (e.g., data derived from data analytics); and</p>

<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> This Principle covers contracts in which the obligation as- sumed by the supplier is to give the recipient access to data on a medium within the supplier&#8217;s control. Parties may wish to choose a contract for sim- ple access to data when they do not want the recipient obtaining full con- trol of (all) the data that are the object of the bargain. This can be for data privacy/protection, data security, or other reasons, in particular in light of the fact that data that has once been transferred to a recipient can hardly be recovered if used or passed on by the recipient in breach of the terms agreed. Contracts for simple access to data do not fall under Principle 7, but are cov- ered in this Principle (and, to a certain extent, in Principle 9). The main differ- ence between contracts within Princi- ple 7 and those within this Principle is that, under the latter, the supplier does not transfer the data to a medium under the control of the recipient but, rather, gives the recipient access to a medium under the supplier&#8217;s control on which the data is stored.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">42. Car manufacturer S con- ducts intensive research on the development of new car models, collecting vast amounts of test data on various prototypes and their components. The data would enable engine manufacturer R to learn bet- ter how its engines operate and how they can be improved. S is willing to enter into a contract with R that would enable R to obtain that ben- efit but, in light of the vast invest- ment made by S into the research and the risk that any data trans- ferred to R will be passed on to com- petitors or hacked by third parties, S is reluctant to transfer the test data to R. Rather, the parties agree that R will have access to a defined class of test data on S&#8217;s servers. The contract effectuating this agree- ment is a contract for simple access to data under this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">43. Same facts as Illustration no. 42, except that the contract re- quires S to upload the data to R&#8217;s server. The contract is a contract for the transfer of data under Principle 7.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Contracts for simple access to data can involve situations in which the re- cipient is provided read-only access, as well as those in which the recipient may process the data on the medium within the supplier&#8217;s control, or port particular data. As the key motivation for suppliers to enter into a contract for simple access to data, covered by this Principle, rather than into a contract for the transfer of data, covered by Principle 7, is typically for the suppli- er to remain in full control of the data, this motivation may be best served if access is provided to the recipient on a read-only basis. However, a read-on- ly basis is often not sufficiently useful for the recipient. This is why parties frequently agree that the recipient is permitted not only to read the data but also to process the data on the medium within the supplier&#8217;s control, or port particular data. Such contracts also fall under this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">44. In order to benefit from the test data and be able to improve its engines, R in Illustration no. 42 would need to conduct its own re- search using the data. Accordingly, S and R agree that R may run its own data analytics on S&#8217;s servers, thus engaging in data processing on a medium controlled by S. Because R wants to use the results of such data analytics in R&#8217;s own factory, S and R agree that R may port the re- sults of data analytics, transferring those results to R&#8217;s own servers. The contract is a contract for simple access to data under this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>The greater the portion of data the recipient is allowed to port, the more similar in effect the transaction will be to a contract for the transfer of data under Principle 7.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms with regard to the mode of the recipient&#8217;s access to the data.</i> The default terms in paragraph (2)(a) of this Principle regarding the mode of the recipient&#8217;s access to the data are necessarily more complex than the terms stated in Principle 7 with respect to the mode of supply.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, because the access will typ- ically be secure, paragraph (2)(a)(i) of this Principle states that the supplier must provide the recipient with the necessary access credentials and re- move any technical barriers whose re- moval could reasonably be expected in a transaction of the relevant kind.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">45. Assume that, in Illustra- tion no. 42, S provides R with the access credentials, but when R tries to access the data, R can read the data, which is encrypted, only if R is prepared to buy special, expensive decryption software used by S but not common in R&#8217;s industry. S could easily decrypt the data itself. R has a right against S that S remove the technical barrier posed by the en- cryption.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, paragraph (2)(a)(ii) of this Principle supplies a default term as to the format in which the data is to be accessible. Under that term, the data must be accessible in a structured and machine-readable format that can rea- sonably be expected in transactions of the relevant kind.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, the default term in para- graph (2)(a)(iii) of this Principle pro- vides that the recipient may access the data remotely unless that is unreason- able in light of data security concerns. Of course, in some cases, the parties may agree that the recipient is allowed to view the data only locally, e.g., when the data is saved on a server without internet connection.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">46. Assume that, in a situa- tion such as the one in Illustration no. 42, when R requests remote ac- cess to S&#8217;s server for the first time, S denies access, claiming that its internal security policies only allow such data to be accessed locally. In- stead, S insists that R&#8217;s employees must travel to S&#8217;s premises when- ever R intends to access the data. According to the default term in paragraph (2)(a)(ii) of this Princi- ple, S is allowed to deny access to R only if remote access is, in light of the sensitivity of the data and the inherent insecurity of the internet connections available to R, objec- tively unreasonable, and not just according to S&#8217;s internal policies.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fourth, paragraph (2)(a)(iv) of this Principle provides that the recipient may process the data to which the re- cipient is given access only for purpos- es that are consistent with the purpos- es agreed in the contract. This default term differs from the default term pro- vided in paragraph (2)(c) for data to be ported (the latter being the same as un- der Principle 7(2)(c)(iv)). The reason is that the likely primary motivation for parties to enter into a contract for sim- ple access to data under this Principle instead of into a contract for the trans- fer of data under Principle 7 is that the supplier wants to remain in control, in particular due to data security or data privacy/data protection concerns, or any other necessity to remain abreast of data activities with regard to the data in question.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">47. Assume that in a situation such as the one in Illustration no. 42, the parties originally envisaged in their contract that R would engage <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>in certain processing activities to learn better how its engines oper- ate and how they can be improved. However, when analyzing the data, R realizes that there is huge poten- tial in the data for developing a new recommender system for connected cars. Given that this purpose is dif- ferent from the purpose agreed in the contract, and might potentially harm S&#8217;s interests (e.g., if S itself is developing such a service), R can- not simply process the data for that purpose but has to seek an extend- ed agreement with S.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">These reservations do not apply with regard to data that the recipient may port to its own servers, which is why paragraph (2)(c) of this Principle refers to the sales approach adopt- ed under Principle 7(2)(c)(iv) for data ported by the recipient.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fifth, paragraph (2)(a)(v) of this Principle addresses which data the re- cipient is allowed to port. Given that porting data is likely to undermine the motivation of the parties for choosing a contract under this Principle instead of a contract for the transfer of data under Principle 7, this default term is rather restrictive. Under this term, the recipient may port only such data as the recipient could reasonably expect to be allowed to port in a transaction of the relevant kind. paragraph (2)(a)(v) of this Principle also supplies a default term that, if the recipient is entitled to process the data (e.g., by analyzing it) on the supplier&#8217;s medium, the recipient may also port the derived data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">48. According to the contract between S and R in Illustration no. 42, R is allowed to run its own data analytics with its own software in a workspace on S&#8217;s servers in order to learn more about the performance of its engines. However, after the data analytics have been complet- ed and R asks S for the credentials required for porting the results, S claims that porting of any data was not part of the contract, and that R is allowed to port the results of the analytics only if R is prepared to pay a significant extra sum of mon- ey. Even if the contract is silent, R has a right to port the data derived from its own processing activities.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Sixth, paragraph (2)(a)(vi) of this Principle provides a default term that, as is typical in contracts for simple ac- cess to data, the recipient may read, process, or port the data by any means, including automated means, and as of- ten as the recipient wishes during the agreed access period.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">49. Assume that in a situation such as the one in Illustration no. 42, R accesses the data with the help of advanced artificial intelli- gence (AI), which, within only a few hours, analyzes all of the data made accessible to R. S did not anticipate this and claims that this sort of ac- cess is improper and that, if R had disclosed its intentions during the negotiations, the price for the ac- cess would have been much higher. As the parties have left this point open, the default position is that R is entitled to access the data with the help of AI.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Default terms with regard to the characteristics of the data supplied.</i> Paragraph (2)(b) of this Principle indi- cates that, with respect to the charac- teristics of the data supplied, the sup- plier has the same responsibilities as it would have in a contract for the trans- fer of data. See Principle 7(2)(b). This reflects the view that there are no pol- icy reasons for differentiating between a contract for the transfer of data and a contract for simple access to data with respect to these issues. As with the de- fault terms stated in paragraph (2)(a) of this Principle, the parties are free to vary from these terms by agreement.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><i>d. Default terms with regard to legal rights and obligations with re- spect to any data ported by the recipi- ent.</i> As with the rules with respect to characteristics of data supplied, para- graph (2)(c) of this Principle indicates that the supplier in a contract for sim- ple access to data has, as far as data ported by the recipient in accordance with the contract is concerned, the same responsibility with regard to le- gal rights and obligations as it would have in a contract for the transfer of data. See Principle 7(2)(c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Application of other law by analogy.</i> Principle 5 provides that de- fault rules and principles not directly applicable to the transaction at hand but that would govern a type of trans- action akin to the transaction at hand may be applied to that transaction by analogy. Paragraph (3) of this Princi- ple provides additional guidance in the context of contracts for simple access to data. Under the law of most jurisdic- tions, the closest analogy will often be that of some kind of services contract, the service being to enable the recipi- ent to access the data. However, de- pending on the circumstances, and in particular on the extent to which the recipient may port data, appropriate analogies may also be a sale or lease (see Principle 7).</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 9. Contracts for Exploitation of a Data Source</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A contract for exploitation of a data source is one under which the supplier undertakes to provide to the recipient access to data by provid- ing access to a particular device or facility by which data is collected or otherwise generated (the &#8220;data source&#8221;), enabling the recipient to read, process, or port data from the data source.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take prior- ity under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms in addition to those provided in Principle 8 are included in a contract for exploitation of a data source:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) With regard to the mode of the recipient&#8217;s access to the data on the data source:</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) the recipient may port all data collected or generated by the data source; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) access to the data is provided in real time as the data is collected or generated by the data source.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) With regard to the characteristics of the data, there is no re- quirement that the recipient receive data of a particular quality or quantity.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for exploitation of a data source, consideration should be given in particular to:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the degree and duration of control that the recipient is to re- ceive over the data source; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) whether, and the degree to which, the recipient may port data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Under a contract for exploitation of a data source with- in the meaning of this Principle, the supplier undertakes to provide to the recipient access to data by giving the recipient access to a device or facility by which data is collected or otherwise generated. A contract for exploitation of a data source is thus a special type of a contract for access to data, focus- ing on access to, and usually process- ing and/or porting of, data collected or generated by the data source. Thus, the focus of the transaction is the data source rather than the characteristics of the data. If a contract is about ac- cess to particular (existing) data, it is not a contract for exploitation of a data source addressed by this Principle, but a contract for the simple access to data under Principle 8. Contracts for the ex- ploitation of a data source are common in the data economy.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">50. Car manufacturer C makes a contract with business B under which B is granted access to the data generated by the connected cars&#8217; windshield wipers and head- lights, which in turn enables B to provide exact weather reports even for areas where no other weather sensor data is available. Neither C nor B know how much the car own- ers will drive their cars and where and when they will drive them, and C does not make any promise to B in that regard. Because B is grant- ed access to the facility by which data is produced and the contract is not one for access to data under Principle 8, the contract is one for exploitation of a data source.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">51. Company N runs a news website. Use of the website by every visitor is, under contractual agree- ments with N, closely monitored and recorded by data broker B. B will use the data for profiling and scoring purposes. The agreement between N and B is a contract for exploitation of a data source be- cause neither N nor B knows exact- ly how many visitors will use the website and there is no requirement that there be any particular num- ber of visitors.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The technical arrangements for pro- viding the recipient with access to the device or facility as described in para- graph (1) may vary. In particular, it is not necessary that the supplier gives the recipient access to the &#8220;original&#8221; data source. Very often, the parties will agree that the data may be transferred from the original data source to a kind of &#8220;duplicate&#8221; of that source, to which the recipient is then provided access.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">52. In a case such as the one described in Illustration no. 50, car manufacturer C does not wish to give B direct access to its car fleet. Rather, the parties agree to an ar- rangement under which C initiates automatic and continuous transfer of any data generated by the wind- shield wipers and headlights to a server space to which B is then granted access. While this server space is not really the &#8220;data source,&#8221; the parties have made it a &#8220;dupli- cate&#8221; of the original data source. Accordingly, the contract is one for exploitation of a data source.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms.</i> The default terms included in a contract for ex- ploitation of a data source are, as a starting point, the same as under Principle 8. However, there are three additional terms complementing or concretizing the terms listed in Prin- ciple 8(2). In particular, when the de- fault terms in Principle 8(2) refer to what can &#8220;reasonably be expected in a transaction of the relevant kind,&#8221; the fact that the nature of the transaction is one for exploitation of a data source rather than one for access to particular <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>data is relevant in determining those reasonable expectations. More precise- ly, in a contract for exploitation of a data source under this Principle, there are two specific default terms, i.e., that the recipient is (i) permitted to access and port all data generated by the data source, and (ii) given real-time access to the data as the data is generated, or as close to real-time access as is rea- sonably possible.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustrations:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">53. Assume that, in Illustra- tion no. 52, a certain part of the data generated by the windshield wipers is not transferred by car manufacturer C to the medium made accessible to B because C is afraid that this part of the data might disclose details about a new feature C is developing (activation of windshield wipers by the driver&#8217;s facial expression). Unless this was agreed between B and C, pruning the data by C would be in breach of the default terms incorporated un- der paragraph (2)(a)(i) of this Prin- ciple.</p>
<p class="comment_indent1">54. Assume further that, in Illustration no. 52, a certain part of the data generated by the wind- shield wipers is made available to B only with a time lag of up to 30 minutes. Unless this was agreed be- tween B and C, this deviation from real-time access would be inconsis- tent with the reasonable expecta- tions of parties in a transaction of this kind and C would be in breach of the default terms incorporated under paragraph (2)(a)(ii) of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Another key difference between contracts for simple access to partic- ular data under Principle 8 and con- tracts for exploitation of a data source under this Principle concerns terms as to the characteristics and quantity of data: Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the supplier in a contract governed by this Principle has no ob- ligation with respect to the quality or quantity of data to which the recipient will have access. Of course, parties will sometimes deviate from this default rule and agree, e.g., that the recipient will be enabled to harvest a particular minimum quantity of data and/or data of a particular minimum quality. But if both the quality and the quantity of data are clearly defined in the agree- ment, the transaction would often be one in which the recipient is granted access to &#8220;particular data&#8221; and the con- tract would be subject only to Principle 8. It is worth noting that the terms list- ed in Principle 7(2)(b) and incorporat- ed in Principle 8(2)(b) still apply, and thus, for example, material descrip- tions or representations would still be relevant.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">55. Assume that, in Illustra- tion no. 50, business B approaches car manufacturer C, describes to C its plans to develop a smart weath- er report service for remote areas, and asks C whether there is any data generated by C&#8217;s cars that would be suitable for this purpose. C then offers to B access to the con- nected cars&#8217; windshield wipers and headlights, to which B agrees. It turns out, however, that the head- lights do not at all react to different weather conditions, but run in the same mode irrespective of whether rain is pouring or the sun shining, and that the windshield wipers are automatically activated also when there is dust on the windshield, rendering the windshield wiper data much less useful for B&#8217;s pur- poses. As C had notice of B&#8217;s partic- ular purpose for obtaining the data and that B was relying on C&#8217;s skill or judgment in selecting the data source, the data source must be fit for the recipient&#8217;s particular pur- poses. However, unless the parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>have agreed otherwise, B would not be entitled to a particular quantity of headlight or windshield wiper data and, for example, B would not have any rights against C if it turns out that buyers of C&#8217;s cars are be- coming more climate-aware and use their cars less often.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">As to terms with regard to control or use of any data ported by the recip- ient in accordance with the contract, the same default rules apply as under a contract for access to data under Prin- ciple 8.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">56. In Illustration no. 51, com- pany N would be under an obliga- tion vis-&#224;-vis B to seek valid consent from the visitors to the website or to ensure otherwise that relevant data privacy/data protection legislation is complied with. However, unless otherwise agreed, N has no obliga- tions with respect to the number of clicks from visitors.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Application of other law by analogy.</i> Contracts for access to a data source do not readily analogize to oth- er well-developed sets of contract law rules. A functional analogy might be that of a lease of the medium, de- vice, or facility to which the recipient is granted access, when the recipient gets a significant degree of (temporary) control over that source. This device or facility is often owned or otherwise run by the supplier, so if the supplier con- tracts for the use of that facility by the recipient for the purpose of collecting and further processing data, it is not far-fetched to analyze this as a form of lease or a contract akin to a lease. This analysis may be useful when, for instance, a court needs to fill a gap in the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">57. In Illustration no. 51, com- pany N enters into a contract with B to allow it to use the news web- site, for a specified amount of time, for monitoring and recording the browsing behavior of visitors. N&#8217;s obligation vis-&#224;-vis B to enable it to pursue its activities during that time period could be analogized to the obligation of a lessor to enable a lessee to use a leased facility. Accordingly, should B claim that it accessed the data only during a small portion of that time, and thus should not have to pay for the por- tion of the access period that it did not utilize, that claim would not succeed, just as a lessee of a facility must pay the full lease price with- out regard to how often it used the facility during the term of the lease.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In jurisdictions where there is a dif- ference between such lease contracts in which the lessee is allowed only to use the leased object, and lease contracts in which the lessee may derive and keep the fruits of the leased object (such as the crop yielded by a farm or the profit yielded by a restaurant) the appropri- ate analogy would be rather the latter, depending on whether and to what ex- tent the recipient is allowed to port and keep data.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 10. Contracts for Authorization to Access Data</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A contract for authorization to access data is one under which the supplier (referred to in this Principle as the &#8220;authorizing party&#8221;) au- thorizes the access to data or a data source by the recipient, including usually processing or porting of the data, but when, in light of the passive nature of the authorizing party&#8217;s anticipated conduct under the contract and the authorizing party&#8217;s lack of meaningful influence on the transaction, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the authorizing party cannot reasonably be expected to undertake any responsibilities of the sort described in Principles 7 to 9.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that in a contract for authoriza- tion to access data:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) with regard to the mode of the recipient&#8217;s access, a term that the authorizing party will facilitate or assist the recipient in gaining access is not included, and the authorizing party may continue using the data or data source in any way, even if this impairs the recipient&#8217;s access or even renders it impossible;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) with regard to the characteristics of the data, there is no re- quirement that the recipient will receive data of a particular quality or quantity;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) with regard to control of the data and any other data activities the recipient may engage in, the authorizing party has no obligation to ensure that the recipient will have any particular rights;</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) as between the authorizing party and the recipient, the re- cipient is responsible for compliance with any duties vis-&#224;-vis third parties under Part IV, including the duties incumbent on a supplier of data under Principle 32; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) the recipient must indemnify the authorizing party for any li- ability vis-&#224;-vis third parties that follows from the authorizing party&#8217;s authorization to access the data unless such liability could not reason- ably be foreseen by the recipient.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for authorization to ac- cess data, consideration should be given to whether the focus of the agree- ment between the parties is on the access to the data or on the supply of another commodity (such as a digital service) in the course of which access to the data occurs.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> This Principle address- es data transactions in which the au- thorizing party provides the recipient with access and allows processing but undertakes no obligations with respect to that data. In contrast to a contract for access to particular data under Principle 8 or for access to a data source under Principle 9, the authorizing par- ty does not in any way undertake to support the recipient in accessing or processing the data, or to remove any technical or legal barriers.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms.</i> As set out in paragraph (2), the default terms in a contract for authorization to access are rather minimal, putting no obliga- tions on the authorizing party. In par- ticular, subject to contrary agreement of the parties as far as such contrary agreement is consistent with manda- tory law (see Principle 5), the supplier (who, in order to contrast the position of the parties in the contracts governed by this Principle with those covered by Principles 7 to 9, is referred to as the &#8220;authorizing party&#8221;) does not under- take to facilitate or assist the recipient <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>in gaining access. Also, the authorizing party may continue using the data or data source (e.g., an electronic device) as the authorizing party wishes, even if this impairs the recipient&#8217;s access or renders it impossible (e.g., because the device is disconnected from the inter- net). Accordingly, the authorizing par- ty does not warrant that the recipient will receive data of a particular quali- ty, fitness for purpose, or quantity, nor that the recipient will have a partic- ular legal position with regard to the data.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">58. Provider M provides a messenger application and service &#8220;for free.&#8221; In return, users authorize the processing of personal data on the device on which the application is installed for a variety of purposes that are in M&#8217;s commercial interest. In this passive access situation, the users are under no obligation actu- ally to use the messenger service, to produce a minimum quantity of user-generated data, or to produce data of a particular quality (e.g., data that reveals the actual identi- ty of the individuals with whom the users correspond). Users are also free to delete the application, thus making any further access to the data source on the part of M impos- sible.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Duties with respect to third parties.</i> Unlike the contracts described in Principles 7 to 9, in which the de- fault terms primarily impose duties on the supplier, this Principle contains de- fault terms that impose significant du- ties on the recipient. If the authorizing party were to qualify as a normal &#8220;sup- plier,&#8221; it would be subject both to any duties it owes vis-&#224;-vis third parties under Principle 32 and to potential lia- bility when those duties are breached; but in a contract for authorization to access, those costs should not ordinari- ly be borne by the authorizing party, whose role is quite passive. According- ly, paragraph (2)(d) of this Principle supplies a default term stating that the recipient is, as between the authoriz- ing party and the recipient, responsi- ble for complying with the duties under Principle 32. Also, under paragraph (2)(e) of this Principle, the recipient must indemnify the authorizing party for any liability vis-&#224;-vis third parties that follows from authorization to process data unless such liability was not rea- sonably foreseeable by the recipient.</p>

Assuming that provider M in Illustration no. 58 not only instigates user C to permit pro- cessing of C&#8217;s own personal data, but also to &#8220;authorize&#8221; the process- ing of personal data of all individ- uals displayed under C&#8217;s contacts on the mobile device.

<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Application of other law by analogy.</i> In deciding which law to apply by analogy within the meaning of Prin- ciple 5, the focus of the parties&#8217; agree- ment should be considered. In some transactions, access to the data may be the main subject matter of the agree- ment. More often, however, access to the data is not what the agreement, as reflected in the parties&#8217; declarations and any contract documents, is mainly about, but, rather, is an incidental ele- ment within a wider transaction about something else, such as provision of some digital service (e.g., search engine service, navigation service, messenger service) by the recipient of the data to whom authorization to access is grant- ed. When this is the case, authorization <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to access is best seen not as the defining characteristic of the transaction but, rather, as a substitute for payment in money for the digital service.</p>

<p class="comment_indent1">60. In Illustration no. 58, user C allows provider M to use C&#8217;s devic- es (e.g., a mobile phone and messen- ger application) for the collection of personal data.

<p class="comment_indent1">61. Farm corporation F buys a &#8220;smart&#8221; tractor from seller S, which has been manufactured by manu- facturer T. The tractor comes with digital services, including weather forecasts, soil analyses, targeted recommendations concerning the use of particular fertilizers and in- secticides, and predictive mainte- nance, to be provided by T and com- panies U and V that cooperate with T. T, U, and V will normally use the data that is collected by the sensors of the tractor for their own commer- cial purposes. Economically speak- ing, T, U, and V will consider the value of the data they will probably receive, and the profits they can de- rive from exploiting the data, when calculating the price to be charged for the tractor and any digital ser- vice provided.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The insight that authorizing the processing of user-generated data amounts to a form of payment, at least from an economic point of view, may be relevant in a number of different con- texts. For example, when a jurisdiction provides different rules for gratuitous contracts and for non-gratuitous con- tracts, the fact that data is provided in lieu of a sum of money may mean that the contract should be treated as a non-gratuitous contract.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 11. Contracts for Data Pooling</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A contract for data pooling is one under which two or more parties (the &#8220;data partners&#8221;) undertake to share data in a data pool by:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) transferring particular data to a medium that is jointly con- trolled by the data partners or that is controlled by a data trustee or escrowee or other third party acting on behalf of the data partners; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) granting each other access to particular data or the possibility to exploit particular data sources, with or without the involvement of a third party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) This Principle applies, with appropriate adjustments, to the gov- erning principles of any entity created pursuant to a data pooling con- tract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority pursuant to Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a contract for data pooling:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) A data partner may utilize data from the data pool, or data derived from such data, only</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) for purposes agreed upon between the data partners in the contract for data pooling;</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) for purposes that the relevant data partner could reason- ably expect to be accepted by the other data partners, unless these <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>purposes are inconsistent with an agreement referred to in para- graph (3)(a)(i); or</p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) as necessary to comply with applicable law.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) A data partner may engage data processors, but may other- wise pass data from the data pool, or data derived from such data, on to third parties only under the conditions agreed upon between the data partners or required by applicable law.</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) As between the data partners, new intellectual property rights or similar rights created with the use of data from the data pool belong to the partner or partners who conducted the activity leading to the creation of the new right.</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) If a data partner leaves the data pool, the data supplied by that data partner must be returned to the relevant data partner, but data derived from that data, unless essentially identical with the data originally supplied by that data partner, remains in the pool. Upon leaving the data pool, a data partner is entitled to a copy of any data in the pool that has been derived, in whole or in substantial part, from data originally supplied by that data partner.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for data pooling, con- sideration should be given to whether the relationship between the data partners is one characterized by mutual trust and confidence, such that the data partners owe each other fiduciary obligations, or, rather, wheth- er it is characterized by arm&#8217;s length transactions with no fiduciary obli- gations.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope</i>. This Principle applies to a phenomenon under which sepa- rate parties, which are here called the &#8220;data partners,&#8221; agree to share data in a way that there is not a &#8220;supplier&#8221; and a &#8220;recipient&#8221; but that each of the parties is, at the same time, both sup- plier and recipient with regard to data shared in a data pool. Often, such ar- rangements are referred to as &#8220;closed data platforms,&#8221; with &#8220;closed&#8221; indicat- ing that the data pool is accessible only to the data partners involved and not to a wider public, such as under open data schemes. The technical and legal arrangements in place may vary. Very often, the data partners will transfer data to a medium (or a defined sector of such a medium, such as cloud space) that is controlled jointly by all partners or by a third party. The third party may, in particular, be a &#8220;data trustee&#8221; within the meaning of Principle 13, or an &#8220;escrowee&#8221; within the meaning of Principle 14, or a new company es- tablished and held jointly by the data partners specifically for the purpose of managing and exploiting the data pool. But it is also possible that the data pool is held in a decentralized manner on media controlled by each of the data partners, who then give access to that data to the other data partners with- in the meaning of Principle 8. Often, the data partners will focus on the exploitation of particular data sources within the meaning of Principle 9 rath- er than on particular data. All these arrangements may be classified as con- tracts for data pooling.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">62. Tractor manufacturers M, N, and O agree to pool, and there- fore to grant each other access to, a particular type of data generated by their respective smart tractors with the aim of better enabling each of them to provide a smart service, such as recommendations as to op- timal use of insecticides, to farmers. If M, N, and O transfer particular data sets from the past to a server controlled jointly by M, N, and O, this is a contract for data pooling based on data transfer (Principle 7). If M, N, and O provide each other with access credentials to particu- lar data sets stored on their respec- tive servers, this is a contract for data pooling based on data access (Principle 8). If M, N, and O prom- ise each other access to all the data produced by their fleet of tractors, which will be transferred in real time to a server controlled jointly by M, N, and O, this is a contract for data pooling based on exploitation of data sources (Principle 9).</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms</i>. As with other contracts addressed in this Chapter, parties to contracts for data pooling will likely negotiate and draft contrac- tual language to cover important busi- ness terms, but it may still be essential to determine the parties&#8217; rights and responsibilities with respect to matters that were not the subject of explicit agreement. Paragraphs (3) and (4) of this Principle address some of these is- sues.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The application of paragraph (3) depends on which of the three types of data pooling contract is present. In cases in which the contract provides for the transfer of data to a closed plat- form that is jointly controlled by the data partners or that is controlled by a third party acting on behalf of the data partners, the default rules in Principle 7 are applicable. In cases in which the contract provides for the parties grant- ing each other access to the data, the default rules in Principle 8 are applica- ble. Finally, in cases in which the con- tract provides for the parties granting each other the right to exploit partic- ular data sources, the default rules in Principle 9 are applicable. In addition to incorporating default rules from Principles 7 to 9, paragraph (3) adds four more default rules.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, in contrast with the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach chosen by Principle 7 and, as far as data rightfully ported are concerned, by Principles 8 and 9, this Principle opts for a &#8220;license&#8221; approach. This means that a data partner may utilize data from the data pool only for the purposes agreed upon between the data partners or required by law. As the parties may not be able to think of all eventualities, paragraph (3)(a) clar- ifies that a data partner may also use data from the data pool for purposes that data partner could reasonably ex- pect to be accepted by all the other data partners.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">63. Assume that M, N, and O in Illustration no. 62 agree that the pooled tractor data may be used for improving the databases for an enu- merative list of precision farming services. N decides to engage also in real estate services, arranging deals between buyers and sellers of farmland and providing services in this context. Without an additional agreement between M, N, and O to that end, N would not be allowed to use data from the data pool (other than the data N itself contributed) for this new purpose. N would not be able to rely on a reasonable ex- pectation that the other partners would accept this, as it significantly enhances the data pool&#8217;s utility for N, at the expense of M and O, which might have had similar plans, or might even get into trouble with the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>farmers using their tractors. If, on the other hand, N wishes to report on the new data pool at its annual shareholder meeting and to show some slides with statistical data de- rived from the data in the pool, and the data does not disclose anyone&#8217;s business secrets, N could reason- ably expect that this would be ac- cepted by M and O.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, in line with this &#8220;license ap- proach,&#8221; paragraph (3)(b) states that a data partner may engage data proces- sors, but may otherwise pass data from the data pool, or data derived from such data, on to third parties only under the conditions agreed upon between the data partners or mandated by law. Af- ter all, it can be expected that the data partners are agreeing to share among themselves and would want the right to prevent others who are not parties to the contract from obtaining access to the data.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, the default rules in para- graph (3)(c) address the topic of own- ership of new intellectual property rights or similar rights created with use of the shared data. Paragraph (3)(c) provides, as a default rule, that new intellectual property rights or similar rights created with the use of data re- trieved from the platform shall belong, as between the data partners, to the partner or partners who conducted the activity leading to the creation of the new right. With this as a default rule, the parties will have an incentive to bargain explicitly if they want a differ- ent allocation of such new rights. While paragraph (3)(c) provides a default rule for ownership of those new rights, it should be noted that applicable in- tellectual property law might require the parties to execute an instrument transferring those rights from whoev- er would own them under that law to those who are to own them under the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">64. Assume that N and O in Illustration no. 62, with the help of data from the pool and in line with the purposes agreed upon between all three partners, develop, with the help of their respective research and development departments, a new smart service with significant- ly more granular recommendations as to the type and optimal amount of insecticides required. As between the three data partners, the intel- lectual property rights in this new smart service (the type of which, such as copyright or a patent right, would depend on the applicable in- tellectual property regime) would belong to N and O, who have invest- ed in the development of the new service, unless M, N, and O have agreed otherwise. If the applicable intellectual property regime assigns rights in a different manner, there would, by default, be a contractual obligation to bring the situation, as between the data partners, into line with paragraph (3)(c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fourth, paragraph (3)(d) together with Principle 4(2) provides that if a data partner leaves the data pool, the data supplied by that data partner must be erased. Upon leaving the data pool, a data partner is entitled to a copy of any data in the pool that has been derived, in whole or to a substantial part, from data supplied by that data partner. (Naturally, when the whole data pooling contract is terminated and all data partners leave the pool, this applies to all of the partners.).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">65. Assume that O in Illus- tration no. 62 decides to leave the data pooling contract, which is si- lent as to the further destiny of the data. In this case, paragraph (3)(d) provides that the data generated by all smart tractors produced by O must be returned to O and must <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>be erased from the pool. If data has been derived from that data, and the derived data is not essentially identical to the data contributed by O (such as in Illustration no. 64 in which O&#8217;s data has been aggregated with N&#8217;s data to create added value) the derived data may remain in the pool, but O is entitled to a copy.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Application of other law by analogy.</i> When deciding which oth- er law to apply&#8212;either directly or by analogy&#8212;the first question that needs to be asked is whether or not a com- pany under company law has been es- tablished, in which case many issues, such as the contributions to be made by the partners, and the benefits to be derived by the partners, would be reg- ulated directly by company law. Gener- ally speaking, consideration should be given to whether the relationship be- tween the data partners is one charac- terized by mutual trust and confidence, such that the data partners owe each other fiduciary obligations, or, rather, whether it is characterized by arm&#8217;s length transactions with no fiduciary obligations.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>CHAPTER C <br/>CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES WITH REGARD TO DATA</b></p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 12. Contracts for the Processing of Data</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A contract for the processing of data is one under which a proces- sor undertakes to process data on behalf of the controller. Such process- ing may include, inter alia:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the collection and recording of data (e.g., data scraping);</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) storage or retrieval of data (e.g., cloud space provision);</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) analysis of data (e.g., data analytics services);</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) organization, structuring, presentation, alteration, or combi- nation of data (e.g., data management services); or</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) erasure of data.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a contract for the processing of data:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the processor must follow the controller&#8217;s directions, including by allowing the porting of data at the controller&#8217;s request at any time, and act consistently with the controller&#8217;s stated purposes for the pro- cessing;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the processor must ensure at least the same level of data se- curity and of protection for the rights of third parties as the controller was under an obligation to ensure, and must support the controller in complying with any legal obligations for the protection of third parties that could reasonably be expected in a situation of the relevant kind or of which the processor had notice when the contract was made;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the processor must not pass the data on to third parties;</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(d) the processor may not process the data for the processor&#8217;s own purposes, except to the extent reasonably necessary to improve the quality or efficiency of the relevant service, so long as this does not harm the controller&#8217;s legitimate interests and is not inconsistent with obligations for the protection of third parties within the meaning of paragraph (2)(b); and</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) upon full performance or termination of the contract, the processor must transfer to the controller any data resulting from the processing that has not already been transferred. The processor must subsequently erase any data retained, except to the extent reasonably necessary for existing or likely litigation or to the extent that the pro- cessor has a legal right or obligation independent of these Principles to keep the data beyond that time.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining which rules and principles to apply directly or by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for processing of data, consideration should be given to the nature of the service, such as to whether the focus is on changing the data or on keeping it safe.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Contracts for the pro- cessing of data, as described in para- graph (1), are common. Given the broad definition of &#8220;processing&#8221; under Principle 3(1)(c), these contracts may appear in an extremely broad variety of forms. Contracts for processing of data may relate to the collection and recording of data (e.g., data scraping), to its storage or retrieval (e.g., cloud space provision), to its organization, structuring, presentation, alteration, or combination (e.g., data management services), to analysis of it (e.g., data an- alytics services), or to its erasure.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">66. Real property business C hires the services of company P to create digital twins of C&#8217;s build- ings for facilitating maintenance. This includes the processing of a broad range of data, including data collected by a variety of sensors in the buildings and photograph- ic data collected by drones. In this situation, C defines the means and purposes of the collecting and oth- er processing of the data, and P&#8217;s motivation for processing the data is to fulfill its contract with C, so C is the controller, and P qualifies as a processor, and the contract is one for the processing of data within the meaning of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">The description of &#8220;contract for pro- cessing&#8221; in paragraph (1) of this Prin- ciple should be read in conjunction with the limitation in Principle 2(1) to matters for which the &#8220;primary focus &#8230; is on records of large quantities of information as an asset, resource, or tradeable commodity.&#8221; Accordingly, al- though paragraph (1) of this Principle could be read in isolation as covering some contracts involving the process- ing of data but in which the focus of the transaction is not related to these Prin- ciples (e.g., a photographer&#8217;s services, proofreading a manuscript, etc.), such contracts are not within the scope of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In light of the broad definition of &#8220;processing&#8221; under Principle 3(1)(c), situations in which a contracting part- ner engages in processing activities while fulfilling contractual duties will be common even within the general scope of these Principles. However, this Principle should apply only when <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the focus of the agreement is on the processing activities as such, not when processing is necessary merely to fulfill an obligation of a different nature. For example, when the operator of a data marketplace contract within the mean- ing of Principle 15, in order to fulfill its obligations under the data market- place contract by facilitating a transac- tion between the client and other par- ties, processes some data provided by the client (e.g., in order to transfer it to the client&#8217;s contracting party), this still should be treated as a contract under Principle 15, and not under this Prin- ciple; however, as far as the processing activities are concerned, the default terms under this Principle might still prove to be useful. When, on the other hand, data storage and storage man- agement are important aspects of the contractual obligations of a data trust- ee within the meaning of Principle 13, it may be justified to apply both this Principle and Principle 13 for the re- spective aspects of the bundle of obli- gations.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms applicable to contracts for processing of data.</i> Para- graph (2)(a) is straightforward&#8212;a con- tract for the processing of data has, as a default term, an obligation of the processor both to follow the controller&#8217;s directions and to act consistently with the controller&#8217;s stated purposes for the processing.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">67. If, in a situation such as the one in Illustration no. 66, real property business C directs compa- ny P not to create a digital twin of a particular building (e.g., because of security concerns raised by a state authority that is a tenant in that building), P must comply with that direction, even if there is no explicit clause to that end in the contract. Whether or not P has a claim to be paid for creating a digital twin of that building, if the building was included in the initial contract, is a different question and depends on the applicable contract law.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under this default term, the con- troller may also direct the processor to port the data to another processor. However, the parties are free to agree on a fee for the porting of the data, due to the very nature of the default terms and the hierarchy stated in Principle 5. While the Principles give the control- ler the right to port data at any time, it should be noted that applicable con- tract law might require the controller to fulfill its part of the contract, before the processor is obliged to transfer the data to another person.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">68. Real estate company C in Illustration no. 66 has engaged cloud provider D for the storage of the data. After two months, C wants to switch to cloud provider E, as E also offers data analysis ser- vices in addition to data storage and this all-around package better suits C&#8217;s needs. If C and D didn&#8217;t agree otherwise, D is obliged under the default term in paragraph (2)(a) to immediately transfer the data to E, if C makes that command.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">In the event of a conflict, the con- troller&#8217;s directions typically should prevail, but when the processor is more sophisticated and realizes that the controller&#8217;s directions are inconsistent with the purpose, the processor may reasonably be expected to notify the controller.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under paragraph (2)(b), the proces- sor has a duty to provide the same level of data protection and data security for protecting the rights of third parties as the controller is under an obligation to ensure, and similarly must support the controller in complying with its legal obligations in this regard. Generally, these duties are present only if such obligations could reasonably be expected <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>in a situation of the relevant kind or if the processor had notice of the con- troller&#8217;s obligations.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">69. Assume that C in Illustra- tion no. 66 may create a digital twin of all buildings, but is under an ob- ligation vis-&#224;-vis a state authority that is a tenant of one of C&#8217;s build- ings to treat any data of that build- ing with a particular degree of data security. If P has notice of these requirements when the contract is made, or if the requirements could reasonably be expected, P is under an obligation to apply the same lev- el of security to the data produced.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (2)(c) provides that the processor must not pass data on to third parties because such action by the processor may harm the legitimate interests of one or both the controller and third parties to whom the control- ler is responsible. There may, of course, be situations in which the processor has a legitimate interest in passing on data, e.g., when the processor needs to engage a subcontractor. However, be- cause paragraph (2)(c) is only a default term, the processor and controller are free to agree on appropriate conditions for the engagement and duties of a sub- contractor.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">70. In the situation described in Illustration no. 69, P may require the services of an independent com- pany to produce the digital twins. If this is the case, P must raise this point in the negotiations with C. P would need to procure C&#8217;s agree- ment to use the independent com- pany as a subcontractor. C and P might agree, for example, that the subcontractor is allowed so long as the same level of protection is en- sured, plus that P remains fully re- sponsible for what the subcontrac- tor does.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (2)(d) provides that the processor must refrain from any pro- cessing of the data for the processor&#8217;s own purposes. This should not be inter- preted as implying that the experience gained by the processor cannot benefit the processor in subsequent contracts. For instance, if the processor, in the course of fulfilling its duties under the contract for processing with the control- ler, uses artificial intelligence (AI), and that AI improves by being run on the controller&#8217;s data, the processor may of course keep the improved AI and may benefit from that when dealing with the next customer. As this is merely an in- cidental effect of fulfilling the contract with the controller and does not harm the controller&#8217;s interests, it is not pro- hibited by the default term under para- graph (2)(d). This is why paragraph (2)(d) contains an exception for when use of the data is reasonably necessary to improve the quality or efficiency of the relevant service, so long as this does not harm the controller&#8217;s legitimate interests and is not inconsistent with any of the controller&#8217;s legal obligations for the protection of third parties that could reasonably be expected in a situ- ation of the relevant kind or of which the processor had notice when the con- tract was made.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">71. Assume that P in Illus- tration no. 66 wants to process the data produced for C in two addi- tional ways on which the contract document is silent: (a) analyzing it immediately for internal quality control and optimization of drone trajectories while the contract is still being performed, using only data that has been aggregated with data of other controllers, rendering it unattributable to the control- ler; and (b) retaining the data in a form that is still attributable to C to promote P&#8217;s services. Use of the data in the first way is permitted by <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>this default term because it is for the benefit of C and cannot harm C&#8217;s interests, while use of the data in the second way would not be per- mitted by this default term because it is inconsistent with C&#8217;s legitimate interest.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (2)(e) addresses situa- tions that may differentiate a contract for the processing of data from other service contracts. While a service pro- vider who undertakes to apply fresh paint to a house, or to repair a car, or to transport goods from one place to an- other, has little opportunity to retain the materials provided by the other party after the contract has been per- formed, the situation is different with respect to data. In a contract for the processing of data, the processor would easily be able to retain a copy of the data without the controller&#8217;s knowl- edge and at low cost for storage, etc., creating a temptation to use the data for a separate commercial purpose of the processor. Accordingly, paragraph (2)(e) supplies a default term of the contract to the effect that the processor must erase any data retained by the processor after the contract has been performed and the processed data has been provided to the controller. There may be some circumstances, howev- er, in which retention of a copy of the data for a short period of time after the contract has been performed is not im- proper and is justified, e.g., by the pro- cessor&#8217;s interest in defending itself in pending or imminent litigation. Even in those circumstances, however, re- tention of a copy would be a breach of the supplier&#8217;s obligation if the terms of the contract indicate that retention of a copy is not allowed for that purpose (subject to rules of law that cannot be derogated from by agreement, such as doctrines of unconscionability).</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">72. Company P in Illustration no. 66 retains the data on its serv- ers after having finished its service for C. Retaining the controller&#8217;s data is normally not in conformity with the terms of the contract. How- ever, if C has already announced it will withhold payment because the photographic material was not in conformity with the contract, P may have a legitimate interest in retain- ing the material in order to use it in potential litigation.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Under law governing the litigation process, a party may have a duty to preserve copies, in which case such a mandatory rule would govern.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Protection of third parties.</i> Note that, not only does this Principle provide terms of the contract between the controller and the processor that relate to the protection of third parties, but in addition, Part IV provides rights directly to those third parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Rules applicable to contracts for processing of data.</i> A contract for the processing of data under this Prin- ciple is a service contract. Legal sys- tems typically do not differentiate be- tween services in the brick-and-mortar world and services with regard to data. This is why paragraph (3) limits itself to stating that, in determining which rules and principles to apply directly or by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to contracts for processing of data, consideration should be given to the nature of the service, such as to whether the focus is on changing the data or on keeping it safe.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 13. Data Trust Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A data trust contract is a contract among one or more controllers of data (the &#8220;entrusters&#8221;) and a third party under which the entrusters empower the third party (the &#8220;data trustee&#8221;) to make certain decisions about use or onward supply of data (the &#8220;entrusted data&#8221;) on their behalf, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>in the furtherance of stated purposes that may benefit the entrusters or a wider group of stakeholders (such entrusters or stakeholders being re- ferred to as the &#8220;beneficiaries&#8221;).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A data trust contract and the relationships it creates need not conform to any particular organizational structure and need not include the characteristics and duties associated with a common law trust. This Principle applies, with appropriate adjustments, to the governing princi- ples of any entity created pursuant to a data trust contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Subject to agreement of the parties and to rules that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a data trust contract or are incorporated into the governing principles of any entity created pursuant to the data trust contract:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the data trustee is, subject to paragraphs (3)(b) and (3)(c), em- powered to make and implement all decisions with regard to use or onward supply of the entrusted data, including decisions concerning intellectual property rights and rights based on data privacy/data pro- tection law;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the data trustee must act in furtherance of the stated purpos- es of the data trust contract for the benefit of the beneficiaries and, even if the entrusters are not the beneficiaries, in a manner that is not inconsistent with the legitimate interests of the entrusters of which the data trustee has notice;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the data trustee must follow any directions given by the en- trusters, including by allowing the porting of data at the entrusters&#8217; request at any time, except to the extent that the data trustee has no- tice that the directions are incompatible with the stated or manifestly obvious purposes of the data trust;</p>
<p class="indent1">(d) the data trustee must refrain from any use of the entrusted data for its own purposes and must avoid any conflict of interest;</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) the entrusters may terminate the data trustee&#8217;s power with regard to the data entrusted by them at any time; however, this right may be limited to the extent necessary to take into account reliance and similar legitimate interests of the beneficiaries; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(f) if the data trustee has retained any data entrusted, or any data derived from such data, after the contract has come to an end (by termination or otherwise) the data trustee must return the data to the entrusters, and, when reasonable, take steps to prevent further use of the data by onward recipients.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to data trust contracts, consideration should be given in particular to:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the stated purposes of the data trust contract and the nature of the data and of the parties involved;</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) whether the purposes of the data trust contract are primarily for the benefit of the entrusters or broader constituencies; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the organizational structure of the relationships created by the data trust contract.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope</i>. This Principle pro- vides a general overview of the legal principles recommended for data trust contracts. As noted in paragraph (2), notwithstanding the use of the term &#8220;trust&#8221; in the nomenclature describing these arrangements, the arrangements need not include the characteristics and duties associated with a common law trust. This Principle is stated at a high level of generality because both the subject of data trust arrangements and the nature of those arrangements can vary widely. Moreover, data trust arrangements are an emerging con- cept, with new subjects and mecha- nisms constantly arising. The purpose of this Principle, as of most other Prin- ciples, is facilitative. Thus, the descrip- tion of types of data trust contracts, and the recommended rules to govern them, are not limited to arrangements that are common today; rather, they are designed to be flexible enough to accommodate arrangements that may emerge in the future.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Data trust arrangements within the meaning of this Principle are often combined with arrangements for the processing of data within the meaning of Principle 12, as the data trustee&#8217;s ac- tivities under the data trust arrange- ments would often include storage of data and similar data processing activ- ities. When this is the case, both Prin- ciple 12 and this Principle would apply, with this Principle more specifically dealing with the power of decisionmak- ing, i.e., a power that rests with the controller of data, and not with the pro- cessor. A data trustee is thus a person to whom one or more controllers of data delegate (some of) their powers as con- trollers, while possibly engaging the same party to provide other services under Principle 12.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Data trust arrangements are typi- cally contracts that create a continuing relationship of a particular or indef- inite duration. While, theoretically, any contract dealt with under these Principles could be either a one-time exchange or a continuing relationship, the contracts dealt with under this Principle, as well as some other Prin- ciples, are more often entered into for a particular or indefinite period of time.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Typical data trust arrange- ments.</i> Under this Principle, a wide variety of arrangements may be gov- erned as data trust contracts. All that is needed is a contract of the sort de- scribed in paragraph (1) among an entruster or entrusters and a data trustee under which the data trustee is empowered and directed to make decisions about use and onward supply of the data in furtherance of the stat- ed purpose. Despite this generality, and the wide-open possibilities that it suggests, some types of data trust con- tracts that are found at present can be identified and described.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">For example, one common type of data trust contract (as that term is used in this Principle) is a data man- agement contract, under which one party undertakes to manage data on behalf of another party. An example is provided by personal information man- agement services (PIMS), also known as personal data stores, personal data spaces, or personal data vaults, under which the party undertaking to man- age the data (the &#8220;data trustee&#8221; under the nomenclature of this Principle) is empowered to make decisions on behalf of the entruster with respect to intel- lectual property issues, data protection, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>etc. Such arrangements involve a requirement that the data trustee manage the data for the interest of the entrusters and follow directions that they may give, subject to the en- truster&#8217;s right to withdraw from the ar- rangement at any time. In some ways, such an arrangement is akin to an agency arrangement, with the entrust- er as principal and the data trustee as agent.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">73. Several individuals con- tract with a service provider M un- der an arrangement in which these individuals provide to M access to certain personal information col- lected by and stored on their respec- tive mobile devices. M is given the power to interact with website op- erators that seek personal informa- tion from visitors to their websites and disclose only such information under such conditions as meets cri- teria established in the contract. The contract is a data trust con- tract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Another common type of data trust arrangement is an arrangement under which one party (the data trustee) un- dertakes to control data it has been en- trusted with for a stated purpose, e.g., data donation for health research. As with the data management contract, the greater expertise of the data trust- ee is a motivating factor in entering into the arrangement.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">74. A large number of health care providers contract with data trustee T to provide to T access to data about cases of certain infec- tious diseases so that T can man- age the data and make it available under specified terms to inform dis- ease-control programs in order to target interventions and improve health service coverage. This con- tract is a data trust contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Structure.</i> The arrangement created by a data trust contract can take many forms. In some cases, the data trust contract may result in the formation of a common law trust (in ju- risdictions where that concept exists), but this is not necessary. Similarly, the data trust contract may result in the creation of other arrangements that use trust nomenclature even though they are not common law trusts, such as a Massachusetts Business Trust or a Delaware Statutory Trust or Pur- pose Trust, but this is not necessary either. Rather, the distinguishing fea- ture of the data trust contract is the agreement pursuant to which decisions about access to and use of data are to be made collectively in furtherance of the stated purposes and for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The form of such an agreement, and the decisionmak- ing structure that results from it, is not constrained by these Principles; of course, other law, such as competition law and data privacy/data protection law, may apply and, in some cases, place limits.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Distinguishing between the data trust contract and legal struc- tures it may create.</i> It is important to distinguish the data trust contract&#8212;the contract among the entrusters and the data trustee under which the governing structure is created&#8212;from law governing the structure itself. For example, if the agreement calls for the formation of a common law trust, with a trustee holding the data for the benefit of beneficiaries to whom the trustee owes a fiduciary duty, the law applicable to such common law trusts applies. Similarly, if the data trust con- tract calls for the formation of a typical for-profit corporation or a public bene- fit corporation, the law governing such corporations governs their internal af- fairs. It should be noted, however, that the law governing structures that may be created by a data trust contract of- ten provides for a substantial role for <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>private ordering by agreement among stakeholders. Examples include share- holder agreements with respect to a corporation and the terms of the trust instrument in the case of a trust. The data trust contract can be seen, there- fore, not only as the agreement to cre- ate a particular structure but also as an agreement among the stakeholders in the context of that structure.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Thus, while the default terms pro- vided by this Principle do not impose fiduciary duties in data trust arrange- ments, the form or structure selected by the parties to effectuate their data trust arrangement may do so. In such cases, the fiduciary duties are those created by the law governing the form or structure, and those duties augment the duties imposed by this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Default terms</i>. The default terms for a data trust contract as de- scribed in this Principle are necessarily general in light of the variety of situ- ations in which such a contract may be utilized and the variety of arrange- ments that the parties may devise.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, paragraph (3)(a) provides a term relating to the power to make decisions with regard to use and on- ward supply of the entrusted data. Under this term, the data trustee is, by default, given the power to make all types of decisions with regard to the data, i.e., in the event of doubt the power vested in the trustee is broader rather than narrower. However, that power is always subject to paragraphs (3)(b) and (3)(c), i.e., to the furtherance of the stated purpose of the data trust contract and the benefit of the benefi- ciaries and the legitimate interests of the entrusters, as well as to any spe- cific directions given by the entrusters.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">75. Assume that in a scenar- io such as the one in Illustration no. 74 the agreement between the health care providers and trustee T does not specify clearly which kind of decisions T may take with regard to the data, i.e., it is unclear wheth- er T may pass the data on only to public bodies or may also sell the data to private companies. Under paragraph (3)(a) of this Principle the trustee may make such deci- sions, subject to paragraphs (3)(b) and (3)(c).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, paragraph (3)(b) provides that the data trustee&#8217;s primary obliga- tion is to act in furtherance of the stat- ed purposes of the data trust contract for the benefit of the beneficiaries. This is a critical point inasmuch as it means that gaps or incompleteness in the data trust contract will be filled with terms that are primarily guided by the pur- pose of the contract (which may differ from the private interests of the par- ties).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Third, paragraph (3)(c) provides a default rule directing the data trustee to follow directions given by the en- trusters. In line with Principle 12(2) (a), this may also include the porting of the data at the entrusters&#8217; request at any time. This rule has an important limit, however; the trustee need not (or even must not) follow directions when the trustee could reasonably be expect- ed to realize that the directions are in- compatible with the stated purposes of the data trust. Thus, unless otherwise agreed, the stated purposes of the trust serve as an outside limit on the power of entrusters to direct the data trustee.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">76. If T in Illustration no. 75, by selling the data to private com- panies, would be jeopardizing the legitimate interests of the health care providers, e.g., by potential- ly disclosing very sensitive data about the patients treated by those health care providers and putting the health care providers at risk of being sued by their patients for breach of confidentiality, the power <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>vested in T does not include the power to sell the data to the private companies as this would be incom- patible with paragraph (3)(b) of this Principle. The health care providers could, in addition, give binding di- rections to T under paragraph (3)(c) to refrain from selling the data. However, they could not give direc- tions to T to sell the data if this is in violation of the stated purposes of the data trust contract (e.g., if that stated or manifestly obvious pur- pose includes protection of patients&#8217; rights).</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fourth, paragraph (3)(d) provides a default rule that protects entrusters from data trustees who might use their position to benefit themselves rather than the entrusters. This rule prohib- its the trustee from using the data to serve its own ends rather than the pur- poses of the entrusters; more generally, this rule directs data trustees to avoid conflicts of interest with respect to the data and its stewardship. This is so irrespective of whether the use of the data would also be in violation of the default term under paragraph (3)(b) of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">77. If T in Illustration no. 75 decided to form a research compa- ny and use the data it has been en- trusted with for that company&#8217;s own research, T would be violating the default term under paragraph (3)(d) of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Fifth, paragraph (3)(e) addresses the ability of the entrusters to termi- nate the powers of the data trustee. The term proposed enables the en- trusters to terminate the powers of the data trustee at any time (much like termination without cause in the cor- porate context). This right, however, is limited to the extent necessary to take into account legitimate interests of the beneficiaries of the data trust.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Finally, paragraph (3)(f) states that, upon termination, the data trust- ee must return any entrusted data the trustee has retained, or any data de- rived from such data, and, when rea- sonable, take steps to prevent further use of the data by any onward recipi- ents. This provision is similar to that of Principle 12(2)(e) and if the data trust- ee may also be considered a processor under Principle 12 (which may or may not be the case), the obligation to erase might follow from both Principles.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">78. If in Illustration no. 71, one of the health care providers entrust- ing T with its data, decides that it no longer wishes to participate in the arrangement, it may, under paragraph (3)(e) of this Principle, terminate the arrangement with T at any time. This would mean T may no longer make any decisions with regard to that health care provider&#8217;s data. If that health care provider had transferred the data to storage space within T&#8217;s control, T would have to erase that data. If T has passed the data on to others, the question whether T must also take steps to prevent further use of the data by those onward recipients depends on whether that is reason- able. What counts as &#8220;reasonable&#8221; depends on many factors, including applicable law (such as data protec- tion/data privacy law), any potential adverse effects on the entrusters, and the terms of the contractual ar- rangements T has entered into with the onward recipients in fulfilment of its duties as data trustee.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Incorporation of default terms into governing principles of structure of the data trust.</i> In light of the fact that, as noted in Comment <i>d</i>, a data trust contract often calls for the creation of a structure, such as a corporation or common law trust, that has its own governance principles that allow for <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the autonomy of the parties to shape their relationship, paragraph (3) also provides that the default terms may be effectuated by being incorporated into the governing principles of an en- tity created pursuant to the data trust contract rather than into the data trust contract itself.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>g. Analogies</i>. As noted in para- graph (4), this Principle suggests three approaches to identifying analogies as the source of rules to govern data trust contracts. The first, consistent with principles involving arrangements of entrustment in general, is to take into account the stated purposes of the con- tract as well as the nature of the data and the parties involved. Second, the appropriate analogy will depend on whether the purposes of the data trust contract are primarily for the benefit of the entrusters or broader constitu- encies. Law has long taken different approaches to arrangements that are primarily for private benefit and those that are primarily for public benefit. Thus, if the purpose of the data trust contract is public benefit, appropriate analogies should be drawn. Third, the nature of any organizational struc- ture created by the data trust contract can supply analogies. For example, if the data trust contract contemplates the creation of a corporation that will manage and exploit the data on behalf of the entrusters, an analogy to share- holder agreements in corporations would be useful.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 14. Data Escrow Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A data escrow contract is a contract among one or more parties planning to use data (the &#8220;contracting parties&#8221;) and a third party (the &#8220;es- crowee&#8221;) under which the escrowee undertakes to make sure the powers and abilities of some or all of the contracting parties with respect to the data are restricted (the &#8220;restricted parties&#8221;) so as to avoid conflict with le- gal requirements, such as those imposed by antitrust law or data privacy/ data protection law.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A data escrow contract and the relationships it creates need not conform to any particular organizational structure. This Principle ap- plies, with appropriate adjustments, to the governing principles of any entity created pursuant to a data escrow contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Subject to agreement of the parties and to other principles that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a data escrow contract or are incorporated into the governing principles of any entity created pursuant to the data escrow contract:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the escrowee has such powers with regard to the data as are necessary for the stated purpose of the data escrow contract;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the escrowee must act in furtherance of the stated purposes of the data escrow contract even if such action is inconsistent with interests of the contracting parties that are distinct from the stated purpose of the data escrow contract;</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) the escrowee must not follow any direction given by a contract- ing party that is incompatible with the stated or manifestly obvious purpose of the data escrow contract;</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(d) the escrowee must refrain from any use or onward supply of the entrusted data for its own purposes and must avoid any conflict of interest; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(e) if the data escrow contract is terminated, each party has an obligation during the winding-up of the relationship not to take ac- tions that undermine the stated purposes of the data escrow contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to data escrow contracts, consider- ation should be given in particular to:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) the stated purpose of the data escrow contract and the nature of the data and of the parties involved; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the organizational structure of the relationships created by the data escrow contract.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope</i>. This Principle pro- vides a general overview of the legal principles recommended for data es- crow contracts. It is stated at a high level of generality because, as with data trust contracts, both the subject of data escrow contracts and their na- ture can vary widely, and data escrow contracts are still an emerging concept. The main difference between a data escrow contract under this Principle and a data trust contract under Prin- ciple 13 is that the purpose of a data escrow contract is to limit the powers of some or all parties contracting with the escrowee, whereas under a data trust contract the trustee must, at the end of the day, follow the directions and defer to the powers of the entrusters. This difference entails several consequenc- es, resulting in a set of default terms that is distinct from that under Princi- ple 13.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Purposes of data escrow ar- rangements.</i> The essence of a data es- crow contract is that the restricted par- ties either divest themselves of (full) control of data they hold, transferring that control to a third party (the es- crowee), or take steps to ensure they will never get (full) control of partic- ular data. It might seem anomalous for a party to voluntarily surrender or renounce control. There are, however, situations in which, for regulatory rea- sons or the like, it is important for a person with rights or powers with re- spect to data to surrender or renounce control of that data. Antitrust consid- erations (and related demands of com- petition law) are one example of such a situation; another example is provided by data privacy and data protection law. In such cases, the parties can avoid running afoul of important le- gal rules by renouncing control of data that they would otherwise have.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">79. European company C would like to use a customer man- agement system, run by U.S. soft- ware company S. In order to com- ply with European data protection law, C must ensure its customers&#8217; personal data are not transferred to the United States unless there are sufficient guarantees in place that ensure U.S. authorities cannot access the data merely upon a re- quest made to S. In order to be able to make the deal, C and S therefore enter into an agreement with trust- ed third party E, according to which customer data will be transferred to S only in encrypted form, and it will be only with the help of keys held by E that it will be possible to decrypt <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>the customer data. The arrange- ment between S and E is a data es- crow contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Structure.</i> The arrangement created by a data escrow contract can take many forms. In some cases, es- pecially in legal systems in which es- crow arrangements are common and well understood, the arrangement may be created by an agreement that spells out the terms of the escrow ar- rangement. In other cases, however, the data escrow contract may provide for the formation of an entity of sorts to hold the escrowed data. It is im- portant to distinguish the data escrow contract&#8212;the contract among the con- tracting parties and the escrowee un- der which the governing structure is created&#8212;from law governing the struc- ture itself. For example, if the agree- ment calls for the formation of a public benefit corporation, the law governing such corporations governs its internal affairs. It should be noted, however, that the law governing structures that may be created by a data escrow con- tract often provides for a substantial role for private ordering by agreement among stakeholders. Examples include shareholder agreements with respect to a corporation and the terms of the trust instrument in the case of a trust. The data escrow contract can be seen, therefore, not only as the agreement to create a particular structure but also as an agreement among the stakehold- ers in the context of that structure.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>d. Default terms</i>. The default terms for a data escrow contract as de- scribed in this Principle are necessarily general in light of the variety of situ- ations in which such a contract may be utilized and the variety of arrange- ments that the parties may devise. Ac- cordingly, paragraph (3) identifies only a small number of default terms, which are applicable to all of these arrange- ments in case the contract is silent, and leaves it to the parties to adapt the arrangement to their relevant data es- crow model in detail.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">First, paragraph (3)(a) provides the key governing principle&#8212;the escrowee has whatever powers are necessary for accomplishment of the stated purposes of the data escrow contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Second, paragraph (3)(b) provides that the escrowee&#8217;s primary obligation is to act in furtherance of the stated or manifestly obvious purposes of the data escrow contract. This is a critical point inasmuch as it means that gaps or incompleteness in the data trust contract will be filled with terms that are primarily guided by the purpose of the contract (which may differ from the private interests of the parties). More- over, paragraph (3)(b) provides that the escrowee has this obligation even if its actions would be inconsistent with interests of the contracting parties that are distinct from the stated purpose of the data escrow contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">It follows from this rule that para- graph (3)(c) provides that the escrowee must not follow directions from con- tracting parties when the directions are inconsistent with the stated or manifestly obvious purpose of the ar- rangement.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">80. S and E in Illustration no. 79 did not agree on the exact con- ditions under which S may, as far as necessary for software mainte- nance, get access to particular sam- ple datasets. This gap is to be closed by reference to the purpose of the data escrow contract, which is com- pliance with European data protec- tion law. So, E must take whatev- er steps are needed to ensure that the requirements of European data protection law are fulfilled. This is so even when S (or even both S and C) directs E to transfer particular datasets to the United States <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Fourth, paragraph (3)(d) provides a default rule that protects contract- ing parties from escrowees who might use their position to benefit themselves rather than the position of the con- tracting parties. This rule prohibits the escrowee from using the data to serve its own ends rather than the purposes of the contracting parties.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Finally, paragraph (3)(e) provides that if the data escrow contract is ter- minated, the winding up of the rela- tionship must not occur in a way that poses a threat to the stated purposes of the data escrow contract. In some circumstances, particularly when the purpose of the data escrow contract is to ensure that the restricted parties do not have (full) control of the data, this may mean that a substitute escrowee should succeed to the interest of the original escrowee, or that some other mechanism should be created to ensure that the purpose of the arrangement is not undermined, rather than having control revert to restricted parties.</p>

If the contract with E in Il- lustration no. 79 is terminated, this does not mean that the data can sim- ply be made accessible to S without encryption, because this granting of access would be in breach of the stated purpose.

<p class="comment_indent"><i>e. Incorporation into governing principles of data escrow structure.</i> In light of the fact that, as noted in Com- ment <i>c</i>, a data escrow contract often calls for the creation of a structure, such as a corporation or common law trust, that has its own governance principles that allow for the autono- my of the parties to shape their rela- tionship, paragraph (3) also provides that the default terms of a data escrow contract may be effectuated by being incorporated into the governing prin- ciples of an entity created pursuant to the data escrow contract rather than into the data escrow contract itself.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>f. Analogies</i>. As noted in para- graph (4), this Principle suggests two approaches to identifying analogies as the source of rules to govern data es- crow contracts. The first approach is to take into account the stated purpose of the data escrow contract and the na- ture of the data and of the parties in- volved. The focus on the stated purpose is particularly apt in light of the pur- poses for which data escrow arrange- ments are typically established, as described in Comment <i>b.</i> Second, the nature of any organizational structure created by the data escrow contract can supply analogies. For example, if the data escrow contract contemplates the creation of a corporation that will man- age and exploit the data, an analogy to shareholder agreements or proxies in corporations would be useful.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>Principle 15. Data Marketplace Contracts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">(1) A data marketplace contract is a contract between a party seek- ing to enter into a data transaction (the &#8220;client&#8221;) and a data marketplace provider, under which the data marketplace provider undertakes to en- able or facilitate &#8220;matchmaking&#8221; between the client and other potential parties to data transactions and, in some cases, provide further services facilitating the transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to agreement of the parties and to other principles that take priority under Principle 5, the law should provide that the following terms are included in a data marketplace contract:</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) insofar as the data marketplace provider undertakes to facil- itate or enable a particular step with regard to a transaction, it must provide reasonable support to the client in complying with any legal duties applicable to that step;</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) the data marketplace provider must refrain from any use for its own purposes of data, received from its client, that is the subject of the anticipated transaction; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) upon full performance or termination of the contract, the data marketplace provider must erase any data in its control that is the subject of the anticipated transaction and that it has received from its client, and any data derived from such data.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining which rules and principles to apply by way of analogy, as provided in Principle 5, to data marketplace contracts, con- sideration should be given in particular to:</p>

<p class="indent1">(b) whether, and the extent to which, the payment or other perfor- mance owed to the data marketplace provider depends on the whether the matchmaking results in a data transaction.</p>
<p class="comment_head"><b>Comment:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>a. Scope.</i> Data marketplac- es play an important role in the data economy. They can connect suppliers and recipients of data that, without the help of an intermediary, would not normally be able to find each other and enter into a data transaction without undue burden or expense. The most common transactions facilitated by such intermediaries are contracts for the transfer of data within the mean- ing of Principle 7, followed by contracts for access to data within the meaning of Principle 8. A &#8220;data marketplace provider&#8221; is defined, for the purposes of these Principles, as an intermediary who engages in &#8220;matchmaking&#8221; (i.e., acts as an intermediary facilitating transactions between suppliers and recipients of data). Usually, data mar- ketplaces provide a range of further services to the parties, such as provid- ing the infrastructure for transferring the data and any payment, assisting the parties in complying with legal re- quirements, and providing reputation- al ranking services or services related to complaint handling. There are many types and business models, such as &#8220;one-to-one,&#8221; &#8220;one-to-many,&#8221; and &#8220;ma- ny-to-many&#8221; marketplaces. This Prin- ciple can be applied to each of these models. Some marketplaces have con- trol of the data supplied, while others restrict themselves to the matchmak- ing between supplier and recipient.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">When data is supplied via a data marketplace, there are usually three contractual relationships involved: the relationship between the supplier and the recipient, the relationship between the supplier and the marketplace, and the relationship between the market- place and the recipient. Both the rela- tionships between the supplier and the marketplace and between the recipient and the marketplace are marketplace contracts within the meaning of this Principle.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">82. Truck fleet operator T wants to minimize the amount of <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>time lost to required rest breaks and meal breaks taken by its driv- ers. Through geolocation devices on T&#8217;s trucks, T is aware of where its trucks are at all times but does not always know the most efficient routing for those trucks to make sure that they are near appropri- ate rest and food locations at the best time for breaks. T enters into a contract with intermediary I under which I agrees to find a party that can supply real-time data as to rest and food locations and estimated travel time to them in light of cur- rent weather and traffic conditions so that T can use this information to direct its trucks to the most efficient locations for rest and meal breaks. The contract between T and I is a data marketplace contract.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>b. Default terms.</i> As with other data contracts, this Principle provides several default terms for data market- place contracts. Each of the four sup- plied default terms imposes a duty on the data marketplace provider. Para- graph (2)(a) obligates the provider to assist the client in complying with le- gal duties that apply to the transaction facilitated by the data marketplace provider.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (2)(b) obligates the data marketplace provider to refrain from processing for its own purposes any data that is the subject of a data trans- action that it enables or facilitates.</p>
<p class="comment_indent">Paragraph (2)(c) obligates a data marketplace provider who enters into a data marketplace contract to erase any data in its control that is the sub- ject of the anticipated transaction and that it has received from its client, and any data derived from such data, upon full performance or termination of the contract.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">83. P runs a website on which users can search for hotels avail- able in a particular location on a particular date and compare accom- modations and prices. This service enables P to amass significant data concerning the number of people who are considering travel to those locations on particular dates. P be- lieves that this information would be very valuable to car rental com- panies that have dynamic pricing models so they can adjust their rates in those locations based on an- ticipated demand. P does not, how- ever, have the expertise necessary to identify the appropriate officials of car rental companies to propose entering into data transactions with them. Accordingly, P enters into a contract with data marketplace provider I pursuant to which I per- forms matchmaking between P and car rental companies to enable P to enter into data transactions with those companies. To enable I to per- form its matchmaking most effec- tively, P supplies some of its data to I. When the contract between P and I has been fully performed by I, or has otherwise been terminated, I must erase the data supplied to it by P.</p>
<p class="comment_indent"><i>c. Application of other law by analogy.</i> Contracts with a party that provides matchmaking services are well known in a number of contexts out- side the scope of these Principles. For example, parties wishing to sell real property often contract with match- makers to find buyers for the real prop- erty, and potential buyers will often similarly contract with matchmakers to find appropriate real property within the buyer&#8217;s budget. Similarly, compa- nies seeking loans often contract with matchmakers that can match them with lenders that make loans to other companies in similar circumstances. To the extent that, in the applicable ju- risdiction, default rules and principles have been developed for application to such matchmaking contracts, those <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rules and principles are appropriate to apply to data marketplace contracts by analogy. In some jurisdictions, those legal rules and principles differ de- pending on whether compensation is owed to the matchmaker only if the matchmaking services are successful and whether the matchmaker obtains control over the subject matter of the match.</p>
<p class="comment_noindent"><b>Illustration:</b></p>
<p class="comment_indent1">84. R runs a website contain- ing reviews and rankings of various consumer products. R harvests loca- tion data with respect to customers who access reviews and rankings. Data as to the number of such cus- tomers seeking information about consumer products in a particular location has value to retailers in that location. R enters into a data marketplace contract with inter- mediary I pursuant to which I will be paid a fee for each successful match between R and a retailer with respect to such data; the fee is an agreed fraction of the amount charged by R to the retailer. Under the data marketplace contract, I re- ceives no compensation except for the fee for successful matches. In determining what legal rules and principles to apply by analogy to the data marketplace contract, ref- erence should be made to rules and principles developed for other sim- ilar matchmaking contracts and, in particular, to those in which the matchmaker&#8217;s compensation is de- termined by the number and mag- nitude of successful matches.</p>

<p class="indent">(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), this [Act] applies to electronic records and electronic signatures relating to a transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) This [Act] does not apply to a transaction to the extent it is gov- erned by:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) a law governing the creation and execution of wills, codicils, or testamentary trusts;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) [The Uniform Commercial Code other than Sections 1&#8211;107 and 1&#8211;206, Article 2, and Article 2A];</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) [the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) [other laws, if any, identified by State].</p>
<p class="indent">(c) This [Act] applies to an electronic record or electronic signature otherwise excluded from the application of this [Act] under subsection (b) to the extent it is governed by a law other than those specified in subsec- tion (b).</p>
<p class="indent">(d) A transaction subject to this [Act] is also subject to other appli- cable substantive law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 4. Prospective Application</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This [Act] applies to any electronic record or electronic signature created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored on or after the effec- tive date of this [Act].</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 5. Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures; Variation By Agreement</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) This [Act] does not require a record or signature to be created, generated, sent, communicated, received, stored, or otherwise processed or used by electronic means or in electronic form.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) This [Act] applies only to transactions between parties each of which has agreed to conduct transactions by electronic means. Whether the parties agree to conduct a transaction by electronic means is deter- mined from the context and surrounding circumstances, including the parties&#8217; conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) A party that agrees to conduct a transaction by electronic means may refuse to conduct other transactions by electronic means. The right granted by this subsection may not be waived by agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Except as otherwise provided in this [Act], the effect of any of its provisions may be varied by agreement. The presence in certain provi- sions of this [Act] of the words &#8220;unless otherwise agreed&#8221;, or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Whether an electronic record or electronic signature has legal consequences is determined by this [Act] and other applicable law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 6. Construction and Application</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This [Act] must be construed and applied:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) to facilitate electronic transactions consistent with other appli- cable law;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) to be consistent with reasonable practices concerning electronic transactions and with the continued expansion of those practices; and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this [Act] among States enacting it.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 7. Legal Recognition of Electronic Records, Electronic Signatures, and Electronic Contracts</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforce- ability solely because it is in electronic form.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because an electronic record was used in its formation.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) If a law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 8. Provision of Information in Writing; Presentation of Records</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver informa- tion in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the infor- mation is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt. An electronic record is not capable of retention by the recipient if the sender or its information processing system inhibits the ability of the recipient to print or store the electronic record.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) If a law other than this [Act] requires a record (i) to be posted or displayed in a certain manner, (ii) to be sent, communicated, or transmit- ted by a specified method, or (iii) to contain information that is formatted in a certain manner, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) The record must be posted or displayed in the manner speci- fied in the other law.</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d)(2), the record must be sent, communicated, or transmitted by the method specified in the other law.</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) The record must contain the information formatted in the manner specified in the other law.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) If a sender inhibits the ability of a recipient to store or print an electronic record, the electronic record is not enforceable against the re- cipient.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) The requirements of this section may not be varied by agreement, but:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) to the extent a law other than this [Act] requires information to be provided, sent, or delivered in writing but permits that require- ment to be varied by agreement, the requirement under subsection (a) that the information be in the form of an electronic record capable of retention may also be varied by agreement; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) a requirement under a law other than this [Act] to send, com- municate, or transmit a record by [first-class mail, postage prepaid] [regular United States mail], may be varied by agreement to the ex- tent permitted by the other law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 9. Attribution and Effect of Electronic Record and Electronic Signature</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security pro- cedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attrib- uted to a person under subsection (a) is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adop- tion, including the parties&#8217; agreement, if any, and otherwise as provided by law.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 10. Effect of Change or Error</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission be- tween parties to a transaction, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In an automated transaction involving an individual, the indi- vidual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of an- other person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:</p>
<p class="indent1">(A) promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person;</p>
<p class="indent1">(B) takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person&#8217;s reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration re- ceived, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and (C) has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies, the change or error has the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties&#8217; contract, if any.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Paragraphs (2) and (3) may not be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 11. Notarization and Acknowledgment</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If a law requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.</p>
<p class="head4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>&#167; 12. Retention of Electronic Records; Originals</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) accurately reflects the information set forth in the record after it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or other- wise; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) remains accessible for later reference.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A requirement to retain a record in accordance with subsection</p>
<p class="indent">(a) does not apply to any information the sole purpose of which is to en- able the record to be sent, communicated, or received.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) A person may satisfy subsection (a) by using the services of an- other person if the requirements of that subsection are satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its origi- nal form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or re- tained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with subsection (a).</p>
<p class="indent">(e) If a law requires retention of a check, that requirement is satis- fied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with subsection (a).</p>
<p class="indent">(f) A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with sub- section (a) satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for eviden- tiary, audit, or like purposes, unless a law enacted after the effective date of this [Act] specifically prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">(g) This section does not preclude a governmental agency of this State from specifying additional requirements for the retention of a re- cord subject to the agency&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 13. Admissibility in Evidence</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In a proceeding, evidence of a record or signature may not be excluded solely because it is in electronic form.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 14. Automated Transaction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In an automated transaction, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents of the parties, even if no individual was aware of or reviewed the elec- tronic agents&#8217; actions or the resulting terms and agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contract may be formed by the interaction of an electronic agent and an individual, acting on the individual&#8217;s own behalf or for another person, including by an interaction in which the individual performs ac- tions that the individual is free to refuse to perform and which the individual <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>knows or has reason to know will cause the electronic agent to complete the transaction or performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law applicable to it.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 15. Time and Place of Sending and Receipt</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent when it:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) is addressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an in- formation processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) is in a form capable of being processed by that system; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) enters an information processing system outside the control of the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the sender or enters a region of the information processing system designated or used by the recipient which is under the control of the recipient.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Unless otherwise agreed between a sender and the recipient, an electronic record is received when:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) it enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) it is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Subsection (b) applies even if the place the information process- ing system is located is different from the place the electronic record is deemed to be received under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the sender&#8217;s place of business and to be received at the recipient&#8217;s place of business. For purposes of this subsection, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest re- lationship to the underlying transaction.</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender&#8217;s or recipient&#8217;s residence, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) An electronic record is received under subsection (b) even if no individual is aware of its receipt.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(f) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (b) establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent cor- responds to the content received.</p>
<p class="indent">(g) If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under subsection (a), or purportedly received under subsection (b), was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law. Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 16. Transferable Records</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) In this section, &#8220;transferable record&#8221; means an electronic record that:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) would be a note under [Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code] or a document under [Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code] if the electronic record were in writing; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) A system satisfies subsection (b), and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) a single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) the person to which the transferable record was issued; or</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) if the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable record was most recently transferred;</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;</p>
<p class="indent1">(5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and</p>
<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(6) any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transfer- able record is the holder, as defined in [Section 1&#8211;201(20) of the Uniform Commercial Code], of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under [the Uniform Commercial Code], including, if the applicable statutory require- ments under [Section 3&#8211;302(a), 7&#8211;501, or 9&#8211;308 of the Uniform Commer- cial Code] are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively.

<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 101. (15 U.S.C.A. &#167; 7001). General Rule of Validity.</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) IN GENERAL.&#8212;Notwithstanding any statute, regulation, or other rule of law (other than this title and title II), with respect to any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) a signature, contract, or other record relating to such transac- tion may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.&#8212;This title does not&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) limit, alter, or otherwise affect any requirement imposed by a statute, regulation, or rule of law relating to the rights and obligations of persons under such statute, regulation, or rule of law other than a requirement that contracts or other records be written, signed, or in nonelectronic form; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) require any person to agree to use or accept electronic records or electronic signatures, other than a governmental agency with re- spect to a record other than a contract to which it is a party.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) CONSUMER DISCLOSURES.&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC RECORDS.&#8212;Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires that information relating to a transaction or transactions in or affect- ing interstate or foreign commerce be provided or made available to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>a consumer in writing, the use of an electronic record to provide or make available (whichever is required) such information satisfies the requirement that such information be in writing if&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) the consumer has affirmatively consented to such use and has not withdrawn such consent;</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) the consumer, prior to consenting, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) informing the consumer of (I) any right or option of the consumer to have the record provided or made available on pa- per or in nonelectronic form, and (II) the right of the consumer to withdraw the consent to have the record provided or made avail- able in an electronic form and of any conditions, consequences (which may include termination of the parties&#8217; relationship), or fees in the event of such withdrawal;</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) informing the consumer of whether the consent applies (I) only to the particular transaction which gave rise to the obliga- tion to provide the record, or (II) to identified categories of re- cords that may be provided or made available during the course of the parties&#8217; relationship;</p>
<p class="indent3">(iii) describing the procedures the consumer must use to with- draw consent as provided in clause (i) and to update information needed to contact the consumer electronically; and</p>
<p class="indent3">(iv) informing the consumer (I) how, after the consent, the consumer may, upon request, obtain a paper copy of an electron- ic record, and (II) whether any fee will be charged for such copy;</p>
<p class="indent2">(C) the consumer&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) prior to consenting, is provided with a statement of the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of the electronic records; and</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) consents electronically, or confirms his or her consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can access information in the electronic form that will be used to provide the information that is the subject of the consent; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(D) after the consent of a consumer in accordance with sub- paragraph (A), if a change in the hardware or software require- ments needed to access or retain electronic records creates a mate- rial risk that the consumer will not be able to access or retain a subsequent electronic record that was the subject of the consent, the person providing the electronic record&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) provides the consumer with a statement of (I) the revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>of the electronic records, and (II) the right to withdraw consent without the imposition of any fees for such withdrawal and with- out the imposition of any condition or consequence that was not disclosed under subparagraph (B)(i); and</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) again complies with subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) OTHER RIGHTS.&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) PRESERVATION OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.&#8212;Nothing in this title affects the content or timing of any disclosure or other record required to be provided or made available to any consumer under any statute, regulation, or other rule of law.</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) VERIFICATION OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT.&#8212;If a law that was enacted prior to this Act expressly requires a record to be provided or made available by a specified method that requires ver- ification or acknowledgment of receipt, the record may be provided or made available electronically only if the method used provides verification or acknowledgment of receipt (whichever is required).</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO OBTAIN ELECTRONIC CON- SENT OR CONFIRMATION OF CONSENT.&#8212;The legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by that consumer in accordance with para- graph (1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) PROSPECTIVE EFFECT.&#8212;Withdrawal of consent by a con- sumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided or made available to that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consum- er&#8217;s withdrawal of consent. A consumer&#8217;s withdrawal of consent shall be effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the with- drawal by the provider of the record. Failure to comply with paragraph (1)(D) may, at the election of the consumer, be treated as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="indent1">(5) PRIOR CONSENT.&#8212;This subsection does not apply to any re- cords that are provided or made available to a consumer who has con- sented prior to the effective date of this title to receive such records in electronic form as permitted by any statute, regulation, or other rule of law.</p>
<p class="indent1">(6) ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.&#8212;An oral communication or a recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an electronic record for purposes of this subsection except as otherwise provided under applicable law.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) RETENTION OF CONTRACTS AND RECORDS.&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) ACCURACY AND ACCESSIBILITY.&#8212;If a statute, regula- tion, or other rule of law requires that a contract or other record relating <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce be retained, that requirement is met by retaining an electronic record of the information in the contract or other record that&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) accurately reflects the information set forth in the contract or other record; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) remains accessible to all persons who are entitled to access by statute, regulation, or rule of law, for the period required by such statute, regulation, or rule of law, in a form that is capable of being accurately reproduced for later reference, whether by transmission, printing, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) EXCEPTION.&#8212;A requirement to retain a contract or other re- cord in accordance with paragraph (1) does not apply to any informa- tion whose sole purpose is to enable the contract or other record to be sent, communicated, or received.</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) ORIGINALS.&#8212;If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires a contract or other record relating to a transaction in or af- fecting interstate or foreign commerce to be provided, available, or re- tained in its original form, or provides consequences if the contract or other record is not provided, available, or retained in its original form, that statute, regulation, or rule of law is satisfied by an electronic re- cord that complies with paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) CHECKS.&#8212;If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law re- quires the retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by reten- tion of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="indent">(e) ACCURACY AND ABILITY TO RETAIN CONTRACTS AND OTHER RECORDS.&#8212;Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a statute, regu- lation, or other rule of law requires that a contract or other record relat- ing to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce be in writing, the legal effect, validity, or enforceability of an electronic record of such contract or other record may be denied if such electronic record is not in a form that is capable of being retained and accurately reproduced for later reference by all parties or persons who are entitled to retain the contract or other record.</p>
<p class="indent">(f) PROXIMITY.&#8212;Nothing in this title affects the proximity re- quired by any statute, regulation, or other rule of law with respect to any warning, notice, disclosure, or other record required to be posted, displayed, or publicly affixed.</p>
<p class="indent">(g) NOTARIZATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT.&#8212;If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires a signature or record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, that requirement is satis- fied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>applicable statute, regulation, or rule of law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.</p>
<p class="indent">(h) ELECTRONIC AGENTS.&#8212;A contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because its formation, creation, or delivery involved the action of one or more electronic agents so long as the action of any such electronic agent is legally attributable to the person to be bound.</p>
<p class="indent">(i) INSURANCE.&#8212;It is the specific intent of the Congress that this title and title II apply to the business of insurance.</p>
<p class="indent">(j) INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS.&#8212;An insurance agent or broker acting under the direction of a party that enters into a contract by means of an electronic record or electronic signature may not be held liable for any deficiency in the electronic procedures agreed to by the par- ties under that contract if&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) the agent or broker has not engaged in negligent, reckless, or intentional tortious conduct;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) the agent or broker was not involved in the development or establishment of such electronic procedures; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) the agent or broker did not deviate from such procedures.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 102. (15 U.S.C.A. &#167; 7002). Exemption to Preemption.</b></p>
<p class="indent">(a) IN GENERAL.&#8212;A State statute, regulation, or other rule of law may modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of section 101 with respect to State law only if such statute, regulation, or rule of law&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) constitutes an enactment or adoption of the Uniform Electron- ic Transactions Act as approved and recommended for enactment in all the States by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uni- form State Laws in 1999, except that any exception to the scope of such Act enacted by a State under section 3(b)(4) of such Act shall be preempted to the extent such exception is inconsistent with this title or title II, or would not be permitted under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(2)(A) specifies the alternative procedures or requirements for the use or acceptance (or both) of electronic records or electronic signatures to establish the legal effect, validity, or enforceability of contracts or other records, if&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) such alternative procedures or requirements are consis- tent with this title and title II; and</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) such alternative procedures or requirements do not re- quire, or accord greater legal status or effect to, the implementa- tion or application of a specific technology or technical specifica- tion for performing the functions of creating, storing, generating, <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>receiving, communicating, or authenticating electronic records or electronic signatures; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) if enacted or adopted after the date of the enactment of this Act, makes specific reference to this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) EXCEPTIONS FOR ACTIONS BY STATES AS MARKET PAR- TICIPANTS.&#8212;Subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) shall not apply to the statutes, regulations, or other rules of law governing procurement by any State, or any agency or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) PREVENTION OF CIRCUMVENTION.&#8212;Subsection (a) does not permit a State to circumvent this title or title II through the imposition of nonelectronic delivery methods under section 8(b)(2) of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.</p>
<p class="head4"><b>&#167; 103. (15 U.S.C.A. &#167; 7003). Specific Exceptions.</b></p>

<p class="indent1">(2) a State statute, regulation, or other rule of law governing adoption, divorce, or other matters of family law; or</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) the Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in any State, other than sections 1&#8211;107 and 1&#8211;206 and Articles 2 and 2A.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) ADDITIONAL EXCEPTIONS.&#8212;The provisions of section 101 shall not apply to&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) court orders or notices, or official court documents (including briefs, pleadings, and other writings) required to be executed in con- nection with court proceedings;</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(c) REVIEW OF EXCEPTIONS.&#8212;</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) EVALUATION REQUIRED.&#8212;The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Communications and In- formation, shall review the operation of the exceptions in subsections (a) and (b) to evaluate, over a period of 3 years, whether such excep- tions continue to be necessary for the protection of consumers. Within 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress on the results of such evaluation.</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) DETERMINATIONS.&#8212;If a Federal regulatory agency, with respect to matter within its jurisdiction, determines after notice and an opportunity for public comment, and publishes a finding, that one or more such exceptions are no longer necessary for the protection of consumers and eliminating such exceptions will not increase the mate- rial risk of harm to consumers, such agency may extend the applica- tion of section 101 to the exceptions identified in such finding.</p>

<p class="indent">Since January 1, 1988 American exporters and importers have been subject to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). With respect to transactions within its scope, it displaces much of Article 2, Sales, of the Uniform Commercial Code&#8212;including, for example, the requirements of the statute of frauds (CISG 11).<b><sup>1</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Convention &#8220;applies to contracts for the sale of goods between par- ties whose places of business are in different States &#8230; when the States are Contracting States&#8221; (CISG 1).<b><sup>2</sup></b> The Convention preserves the autono- my of the parties by allowing them to &#8220;exclude the application of this Convention or &#8230; derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions&#8221; (CISG 6). The Convention does not displace rules of national law that relate to &#8220;the validity of the contract or of any of its provisions or of any usages.&#8221; (CISG 4(a)).<b><sup>3</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent">Work on the Convention began in the 1930s when the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law in Rome, then under the aus- pices of the League of Nations, set up a drafting committee of European scholars to work on a uniform law for international sales. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the committee had prepared a first draft, so- licited comments from governments, and prepared a revised draft taking account of these comments.</p>
<p class="indent">After the War the Dutch Government appointed a commission to do further work, solicited comments from governments and, in 1964, con- vened a diplomatic conference at The Hague. The conference approved a uniform law on the international sale of goods (ULIS) and a shorter com- panion uniform law on the formation of contracts for the international sale of goods.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>1</sup></b> The United States did not make the declaration described in CISG 12.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>2</sup></b> In this context &#8220;States&#8221; means nations and &#8220;Contracting&#8221; means adopting. The United States did not accept CISG 1(b), which would have given the Convention a broader application.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>3</sup></b> For a definitive treatment of the Con- vention, see J. Honnold, Uniform Law for International Sales under the 1980 U.N. Convention (4th ed. 2009). See also C. Bi- anca, M. Bonell et al., Commentary on the International Sales Law: The 1980 Vienna Convention (1987); P. Schlechtriem et al., Commentary on the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) (2d En- glish ed. 2005).</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Although the United States had quickly put together a delegation to The Hague to consider a draft prepared by a group of exclusively Euro- pean scholars, that delegation&#8217;s influence was not pervasive enough to produce a final text that justified United States ratification.<b><sup>4</sup></b> Neverthe- less, ULIS did receive eight adoptions by other countries, enough for it to take effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Even before ULIS had taken effect, however, efforts were afoot under United Nations auspices to produce a revised international sales law that would be more widely acceptable. In 1966, the United Nations General Assembly established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The Commission has &#8220;for its object the pro- motion of the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade.&#8221; Its members include common law as well as civil law countries, developing as well as industrialized countries, and coun- tries with centrally planned economics as well as those with free-market economies.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1969, UNCITRAL appointed a fourteen-member Working Group on Sales to consider what changes in ULIS would make it more acceptable to countries of varied legal, social, and economic systems. The United States was an active member of this Working Group from its inception. In 1977 UNCITRAL revised and approved a text of CISG prepared by the Working Group on Sales, and in 1978 it integrated into CISG additional provisions on formation and interpretation. In 1980, the United Nations held in Vienna a diplomatic conference to propose a final text of CISG. After five weeks of intensive effort by the sixty-two countries represented, CISG&#8212;often referred to as &#8220;the Vienna Convention&#8221;&#8212;was adopted.</p>
<p class="indent">The final product of this half-century of work consists of eighty-eight substantive articles (what we in the United States would call &#8220;sections&#8221;) plus thirteen more articles on effective date, reservations, and the like. Only the eighty-eight substantive articles are set out below. CISG took effect following adoption by ten countries. It has now been adopted by 89 countries (as of April 25, 2018), including the United States.</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>4</sup></b> The traditional scheme for internation- al unification results in a multilateral trea- ty, put in final form at a diplomatic confer- ence and then adopted by ratification or ac- cession. One important difference between this scheme and that used for unification within the United States is that a country ratifying or acceding to a treaty cannot make changes in its text, except for a few variations that the diplomatic conference has allowed countries to make by means of reservations.</p>

<p class="center_hd">THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,</p>
<p class="indent">Bearing in mind the broad objectives in the resolutions adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the establishment of a New International Economic Order,</p>
<p class="indent">Considering that the development of international trade on the ba- sis of equality and mutual benefit is an important element in promoting friendly relations among States,</p>
<p class="indent">Being of the opinion that the adoption of uniform rules which govern contracts for the international sale of goods and take into account the dif- ferent social, economic and legal systems would contribute to the removal of legal barriers in international trade and promote the development of international trade,</p>
<p class="indent">Have agreed as follows:</p>
<p class="head1"><b>Part I. Sphere of application and general provisions</b></p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER I. SPHERE OF APPLICATION</p>

<p class="indent">(1) This Convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between par- ties whose places of business are in different States:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) when the States are Contracting States; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) when the rules of private international law lead to the appli- cation of the law of a Contracting State.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The fact that the parties have their places of business in different States is to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the contract or from any dealings between, or from information disclosed by, the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the application of this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 2</p>
<p class="noindent">This Convention does not apply to sales:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) of goods bought for personal, family or household use, unless the seller, at any time before or at the conclusion of the con- tract, neither knew nor ought to have known that the goods were bought for any such use;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) by auction;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) on execution or otherwise by authority of law;</p>

<p class="hang-indent1">(f) of electricity.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 3</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Contracts for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced are to be considered sales unless the party who order the goods under- takes to supply a substantial part of the materials necessary for such manufacture or production.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) This Convention does not apply to contracts in which the pre- ponderant part of the obligations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour or other services.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 4</p>
<p class="indent">This Convention governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from such a contract. In particular, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention, it is not concerned with:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) the validity of the contract or of any of its provisions or of any usage;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) the effect which the contract may have on the property in the goods sold.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 5</p>
<p class="indent">This Convention does not apply to the liability of the seller for death or personal injury caused by the goods to any person.</p>

<p class="indent">The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or, subject to article 12, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.</p>
<p class="head2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>CHAPTER II. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 7</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its ap- plication and the observance of good faith in international trade.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the gen- eral principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 8</p>
<p class="indent">(1) For the purposes of this Convention statements made by and oth- er conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to his intent where the other party knew or could not have been unaware what that intent was.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the preceding paragraph is not applicable, statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to the un- derstanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In determining the intent of a party or the understanding a rea- sonable person would have had, due consideration is to be given to all rel- evant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 9</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The parties are bound by any usages to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The parties are considered, unless otherwise agreed, to have im- pliedly made applicable to their contract or its formation a usage of which the parties knew or ought to have known and which in international trade is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade concerned.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 10</p>
<p class="indent">For the purposes of this Convention:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, having regard to the circum- stances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual residence.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 11</p>
<p class="indent">A Contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form. It may be proved by any means, including witnesses.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 12</p>
<p class="indent">Any provision of article 11, article 29 or Part II of this Convention that allows a contract of sale or its modification or termination by agreement or any offer, acceptance or other indication of intention to be made in any form other than in writing does not apply where any party has his place of business in a Contracting State which has made a declaration under article 96 of this Convention. The parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of this article.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 13</p>
<p class="indent">For the purposes of this Convention &#8220;writing&#8221; includes telegram and telex.</p>
<p class="head1"><b>Part II. Formation of the contract</b></p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 14</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more spe- cific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the quantity and the price.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A proposal other than one addressed to one or more specific per- sons is to be considered merely as an invitation to make offers, unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the person making the proposal.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 15</p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the with- drawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 16</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revo- cation reaches the offeree before he has dispatched an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, an offer cannot be revoked:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that it is irrevocable; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as be- ing irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 17</p>
<p class="indent">An offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reach- es the offeror.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 18</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror. An acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent does not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction, including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act, such as one relating to the dis- patch of the goods or payment of the price, without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective at the moment the act is performed, provided that the act is performed within the period of time laid down in the pre- ceding paragraph.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 19</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but con- tains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, with- out undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of de- livery, extent of one party&#8217;s liability to the other or the settlement of dis- putes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 20</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror in a telegram or a letter begins to run from the moment the telegram is handed in for <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>dispatch or from the date shown on the letter or, if no such date is shown, from the date shown on the envelope. A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror by telephone, telex or other means of instantaneous communication, begins to run from the moment that the offer reaches the offeree.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Official holidays or non-business days occurring during the period for acceptance are included in calculating the period. However, if a notice of acceptance cannot be delivered at the address of the offeror on the last day of the period because that day falls on an official holiday or a non- business day at the place of business of the offeror, the period is extended until the first business day which follows.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 21</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without delay the offeror orally so informs the offeree or dispatches a notice to that effect.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a letter or other writing containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time, the late ac- ceptance is effective as an acceptance unless, without delay, the offeror orally informs the offeree that he considers his offer as having lapsed or dispatches a notice to that effect.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 22</p>
<p class="indent">An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 23</p>
<p class="indent">A contract is concluded at the moment when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 24</p>
<p class="indent">For the purposes of this Part of the Convention, an offer, declaration of acceptance or any other indication of intention &#8220;reaches&#8221; the addressee when it is made orally to him or delivered by any other means to him per- sonally, to his place of business or mailing address or, if he does not have a place of business or mailing address, to his habitual residence.</p>
<p class="head1"><b>Part III. Sale of goods</b></p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER I. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 25</p>
<p class="indent">A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee, and a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen, such a result.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 26</p>
<p class="indent">A declaration of avoidance of the contract is effective only if made by notice to the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 27</p>
<p class="indent">Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Part of the Convention, if any notice, request or other communication is given or made by a party in accordance with this Part, and by means appropriate in the circum- stances, a delay or error in the transmission of the communication or its failure to arrive does not deprive that party of the right to rely on the communication.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 28</p>
<p class="indent">If, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, one party is entitled to require performance of any obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 29</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or terminated by agreement. However, a party may be precluded by his conduct from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct.</p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER II. OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 30</p>
<p class="indent">The seller must deliver the goods, hand over any documents relating to them and transfer the property in the goods, as required by the contract and this Convention.</p>
<p class="head3">Section I. Delivery of the goods and handing over of documents</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 31</p>
<p class="indent">If the seller is not bound to deliver the goods at any other particular place, his obligation to deliver consists:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) if the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods&#8212;in handing the goods over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if, in cases not within the preceding subparagraph, the con- tract relates to specific goods, or unidentified goods to be drawn from a specific stock or to be manufactured or pro- duced, and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the parties knew that the goods were at, or were to be manu- factured or produced at, a particular place&#8212;in placing the goods at the buyer&#8217;s disposal at that place;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) in other cases&#8212;in placing the goods at the buyer&#8217;s disposal at the place where the seller had his place of business at the time of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 32</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the seller, in accordance with the contract or this Convention, hands the goods over to a carrier and if the goods are not clearly identi- fied to the contract by markings on the goods, by shipping documents or otherwise, the seller must give the buyer notice of the consignment speci- fying the goods.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the seller is bound to arrange for carriage of the goods, he must make such contracts as are necessary for carriage to the place fixed by means of transportation appropriate in the circumstances and according to the usual terms for such transportation.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If the seller is not bound to effect insurance in respect of the car- riage of the goods, he must, at the buyer&#8217;s request, provide him with all available information necessary to enable him to effect such insurance.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 33</p>
<p class="indent">The seller must deliver the goods:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if a date is fixed by or determinable from the contract, on that date;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if a period of time is fixed by or determinable from the con- tract, at any time within that period unless circumstances indicate that the buyer is to choose a date; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) in any other case, within a reasonable time after the conclu- sion of the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 34</p>
<p class="indent">If the seller is bound to hand over documents relating to the goods, he must hand them over at the time and place and in the form required by the contract. If the seller has handed over documents before that time, he may, up to that time, cure any lack of conformity in the documents, if the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>or unreasonable expense. However, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this Convention.</p>
<p class="head3">Section II. Conformity of the goods and third party claims</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 35</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The seller must deliver goods which are of the quantity, quality and description required by the contract and which are contained or pack- aged in the manner required by the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Except where the parties have agreed otherwise, the goods do not conform with the contract unless they:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) are fit for the purposes for which goods of the same descrip- tion would ordinarily be used;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) are fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract, except where the circumstances show that the buyer did not rely, or that it was unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller&#8217;s skill and judgment;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) possess the qualities of goods which the seller has held out to the buyer as a sample or model;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(d) are contained or packaged in the manner usual for such goods or, where there is no such manner, in a manner ad- equate to preserve and protect the goods.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The seller is not liable under subparagraphs (a) to (d) of the pre- ceding paragraph for any lack of conformity of the goods if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of conformity.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 36</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The seller is liable in accordance with the contract and this Con- vention for any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the risk passes to the buyer, even though the lack of conformity becomes apparent only after that time.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The seller is also liable for any lack of conformity which occurs after the time indicated in the preceding paragraph and which is due to a breach of any of his obligations, including a breach of any guarantee that for a period of time the goods will remain fit for their ordinary purpose or for some particular purpose or will retain specified qualities or character- istics.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 37</p>
<p class="indent">If the seller has delivered goods before the date for delivery, he may, up to that date, deliver any missing part or make up any deficiency in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>quantity of the goods delivered, or deliver goods in replacement of any nonconforming goods delivered or remedy any lack of conformity in the goods delivered, provided that the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. How- ever, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 38</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer must examine the goods, or cause them to be exam- ined, within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the contract involves carriage of the goods, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at their destination.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity for examination by him and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or ought to have known of the possibility of such redirection or redispatch, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new destination.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 39</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of conformity within a reasonable time after he has discovered it or ought to have discovered it.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In any event, the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of confor- mity of the goods if he does not give the seller notice thereof at the latest within a period of two years from the date on which the goods were actu- ally handed over to the buyer, unless this time-limit is inconsistent with a contractual period of guarantee.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 40</p>
<p class="indent">The seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of articles 38 and 39 if the lack of conformity relates to facts of which he knew or could not have been unaware and which he did not disclose to the buyer.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 41</p>
<p class="indent">The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party, unless the buyer agreed to take the goods subject to that right or claim. However, if such right or claim is based on industrial prop- erty or other intellectual property, the seller&#8217;s obligation is governed by article 42.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 42</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party based on industrial property or other intellectual property, of which at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>knew or could not have been unaware, provided that the right or claim is based on industrial property or other intellectual property:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) under the law of the State where the goods will be resold or otherwise used, if it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the goods would be resold or otherwise used in that State; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) in any other case, under the law of the State where the buyer has his place of business.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The obligation of the seller under the preceding paragraph does not extend to cases where:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of the right or claim; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) the right or claim results from the seller&#8217;s compliance with technical drawings, designs, formulae or other such specifi- cations furnished by the buyer.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 43</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer loses the right to rely on the provisions of article 41 or article 42 if he does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the right or claim of the third party within a reasonable time after he has become aware or ought to have become aware of the right or claim.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of the preced- ing paragraph if he knew of the right or claim of the third party and the nature of it.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 44</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of article 39 and paragraph (1) of article 43, the buyer may reduce the price in accordance with article 50 or claim damages, except for loss of profit, if he has a rea- sonable excuse for his failure to give the required notice.</p>
<p class="head3">Section III. Remedies for breach of contract by the seller</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 45</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the seller fails to perform any of his obligations under the con- tract or this Convention, the buyer may:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) exercise the rights provided in articles 46 to 52;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) claim damages as provided in articles 74 to 77.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The buyer is not deprived of any right he may have to claim dam- ages by exercising his right to other remedies.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) No period of grace may be granted to the seller by a court or arbi- tral tribunal when the buyer resorts to a remedy for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 46</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer may require performance by the seller of his obliga- tions unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the goods do not conform with the contract, the buyer may re- quire delivery of substitute goods only if the lack of conformity constitutes a fundamental breach of contract and a request for substitute goods is made either in conjunction with notice given under article 39 or within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If the goods do not conform with the contract, the buyer may re- quire the seller to remedy the lack of conformity by repair, unless this is unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances. A request for repair must be made either in conjunction with notice given under article 39 or within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 47</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer may fix an additional period of time of reasonable length for performance by the seller of his obligations.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless the buyer has received notice from the seller that he will not perform within the period so fixed, the buyer may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for breach of contract. However, the buyer is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to claim damages for delay in performance.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 48</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Subject to article 49, the seller may, even after the date for deliv- ery, remedy at his own expense any failure to perform his obligations, if he can do so without unreasonable delay and without causing the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or uncertainty of reimbursement by the sell- er of expenses advanced by the buyer. However, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this Convention.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the seller requests the buyer to make known whether he will accept performance and the buyer does not comply with the request with- in a reasonable time, the seller may perform within the time indicated in his request. The buyer may not, during that period of time, resort to any remedy which is inconsistent with performance by the seller.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A notice by the seller that he will perform within a specified pe- riod of time is assumed to include a request, under the preceding para- graph, that the buyer make known his decision.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A request or notice by the seller under paragraph (2) or (3) of this article is not effective unless received by the buyer.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 49</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer may declare the contract avoided:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if the failure by the seller to perform any of his obligations under the contract or this Convention amounts to a funda- mental breach of contract; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) in case of non-delivery, if the seller does not deliver the goods within the additional period of time fixed by the buyer in ac- cordance with paragraph (1) of article 47 or declares that he will not deliver within the period so fixed.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, in cases where the seller has delivered the goods, the buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided unless he does so:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) in respect of late delivery, within a reasonable time after he has become aware that delivery has been made;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) in respect of any breach other than late delivery, within a reasonable time:</p>
<p class="hang-indent2">(i) after he knew or ought to have known of the breach;</p>
<p class="hang-indent2">(ii) after the expiration of any additional period of time fixed by the buyer in accordance with paragraph (1) of article 47, or after the seller has declared that he will not perform his obligations within such an additional period; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent2">(iii) after the expiration of any additional period of time in- dicated by the seller in accordance with paragraph (2) of article 48, or after the buyer has declared that he will not accept performance.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 50</p>
<p class="indent">If the goods do not conform with the contract and whether or not the price has already been paid, the buyer may reduce the price in the same proportion as the value that the goods actually delivered had at the time of the delivery bears to the value that conforming goods would have had at that time. However, if the seller remedies any failure to perform his ob- ligations in accordance with article 37 or article 48 or if the buyer refuses to accept performance by the seller in accordance with those articles, the buyer may not reduce the price.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 51</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the seller delivers only a part of the goods or if only a part of the goods delivered is in conformity with the contract, articles 46 to 50 apply in respect of the part which is missing or which does not conform.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The buyer may declare the contract avoided in its entirety only if the failure to make delivery completely or in conformity with the contract amounts to a fundamental breach of the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 52</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the seller delivers the goods before the date fixed, the buyer may take delivery or refuse to take delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the seller delivers a quantity of goods greater than that pro- vided for in the contract, the buyer may take delivery or refuse to take delivery of the excess quantity. If the buyer takes delivery of all or part of the excess quantity, he must pay for it at the contract rate.</p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER III. OBLIGATIONS OF THE BUYER</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 53</p>
<p class="indent">The buyer must pay the price for the goods and take delivery of them as required by the contract and this Convention.</p>
<p class="head3">Section I. Payment of the price</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 54</p>
<p class="indent">The buyer&#8217;s obligation to pay the price includes taking such steps and complying with such formalities as may be required under the contract or any laws and regulations to enable payment to be made.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 55</p>
<p class="indent">Where a contract has been validly concluded but does not expressly or implicitly fix or make provision for determining the price, the parties are considered, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, to have impliedly made reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circum- stances in the trade concerned.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 56</p>
<p class="indent">If the price is fixed according to the weight of the goods, in case of doubt it is to be determined by the net weight.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 57</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the buyer is not bound to pay the price at any other particular place, he must pay it to the seller:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) at the seller&#8217;s place of business; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if the payment is to be made against the handing over of the goods or of documents, at the place where the handing over takes place.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The seller must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to payment which is caused by a change in his place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 58</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the buyer is not bound to pay the price at any other specific time, he must pay it when the seller places either the goods or documents controlling their disposition at the buyer&#8217;s disposal in accordance with the contract and this Convention. The seller may make such payment a condition for handing over the goods or documents.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the contract involves carriage of the goods, the seller may dis- patch the goods on terms whereby the goods, or documents controlling their disposition, will not be handed over to the buyer except against pay- ment of the price.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The buyer is not bound to pay the price until he has had an op- portunity to examine the goods, unless the procedures for delivery or pay- ment agreed upon by the parties are inconsistent with his having such an opportunity.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 59</p>
<p class="indent">The buyer must pay the price on the date fixed by or determinable from the contract and this Convention without the need for any request or compliance with any formality on the part of the seller.</p>
<p class="head3">Section II. Taking delivery</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 60</p>
<p class="indent">The buyer&#8217;s obligation to take delivery consists:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) in doing all the acts which could reasonably be expected of him in order to enable the seller to make delivery; and</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) in taking over the goods.</p>
<p class="head3">Section III. Remedies for breach of contract by the buyer</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 61</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the buyer fails to perform any of his obligations under the con- tract or this Convention, the seller may:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) exercise the rights provided in articles 62 to 65;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) claim damages as provided in articles 74 to 77.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The seller is not deprived of any right he may have to claim dam- ages by exercising his right to other remedies.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) No period of grace may be granted to the buyer by a court or arbi- tral tribunal when the seller resorts to a remedy for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 62</p>
<p class="indent">The seller may require the buyer to pay the price, take delivery or perform his other obligations, unless the seller has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 63</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The seller may fix an additional period of time of reasonable length for performance by the buyer of his obligations.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Unless the seller has received notice from the buyer that he will not perform within the period so fixed, the seller may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for breach of contract. However, the seller is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to claim damages for delay in performance.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 64</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The seller may declare the contract avoided:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if the failure by the buyer to perform any of his obligations under the contract or this Convention amounts to a funda- mental breach of contract; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if the buyer does not, within the additional period of time fixed by the seller in accordance with paragraph (1) of article 63, perform his obligation to pay the price or take delivery of the goods, or declares that he will not do so within the period so fixed.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, in cases where the buyer has paid the price, the seller loses the right to declare the contract avoided unless he does so:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) in respect of late performance by the buyer, before the seller has become aware that performance has been rendered; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) in respect of any breach other than late performance by the buyer, within a reasonable time:</p>
<p class="hang-indent2">(i) after the seller knew or ought to have known of the breach; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent2">(ii) after the expiration of any additional period of time fixed by the seller in accordance with paragraph (1) of article 63, or after the buyer has declared that he will not perform his obligations within such an additional period.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 65</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If under the contract the buyer is to specify the form, measure- ment or other features of the goods and he fails to make such specification either on the date agreed upon or within a reasonable time after receipt of a request from the seller, the seller may, without prejudice to any other <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>rights he may have, make the specification himself in accordance with the requirements of the buyer that may be known to him.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the seller makes the specification himself, he must inform the buyer of the details thereof and must fix a reasonable time within which the buyer may make a different specification. If, after receipt of such a communication, the buyer fails to do so within the time so fixed, the speci- fication made by the seller is binding.</p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER IV. PASSING OF RISK</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 66</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer does not discharge him from his obligation to pay the price, unless the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of the seller.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 67</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not bound to hand them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier for trans- mission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of sale. If the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place. The fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods does not affect the passage of the risk.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 68</p>
<p class="indent">The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying the contract of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 69</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he takes over the goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are placed at his disposal he commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) However, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a place of business of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware of the fact that the goods are placed at his disposal at that place.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are considered not to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 70</p>
<p class="indent">If the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract, articles 67, 68, and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on ac- count of the breach.</p>
<p class="head2">CHAPTER V. PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER AND OF THE BUYER</p>
<p class="head3">Section I. Anticipatory breach and installment contracts</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 71</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party may suspend the performance of his obligations if, after the conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations as a result of:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) a serious deficiency in his ability to perform or in his credit- worthiness; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) his conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the con- tract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the seller has already dispatched the goods before the grounds described in the preceding paragraph become evident, he may prevent the handing over of the goods to the buyer even though the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain them. The present paragraph relates only to the rights in the goods as between the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A party suspending performance, whether before or after dispatch of the goods, must immediately give notice of the suspension to the other party and must continue with performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of his performance.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 72</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If prior to the date for performance of the contract it is clear that one of the parties will commit a fundamental breach of contract, the other party may declare the contract avoided.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(2) If time allows, the party intending to declare the contract avoided must give reasonable notice to the other party in order to permit him to provide adequate assurance of his performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The requirements of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the other party has declared that he will not perform his obligations.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 73</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In the case of a contract for delivery of goods by instalments, if the failure of one party to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes a fundamental breach of contract with respect to that instalment, the other party may declare the contract avoided with respect to that instalment.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If one party&#8217;s failure to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach of contract will occur with respect to future instal- ments, he may declare the contract avoided for the future, provided that he does so within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any deliv- ery may, at the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries al- ready made or of future deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for the purpose contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
<p class="head3">Section II. Damages</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 74</p>
<p class="indent">Damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a con- sequence of the breach. Such damages may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of which he then knew or ought to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 75</p>
<p class="indent">If the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replace- ment or the seller has resold the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract price and the price in the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 76</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the party claiming damages may, if he has not made a purchase <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>or resale under article 75, recover the difference between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the time of avoidance as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. If, however, the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 77</p>
<p class="indent">A party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting from the breach. If he fails to take such measures, the party in breach may claim a reduction in the damages in the amount by which the loss should have been mitigated.</p>
<p class="head3">Section III. Interest</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 78</p>
<p class="indent">If a party fails to pay the price or any other sum that is in arrears, the other party is entitled to interest on it, without prejudice to any claim for damages recoverable under article 74.</p>
<p class="head3">Section IV. Exemptions</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 79</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impedi- ment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the party&#8217;s failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has engaged to perform the whole or a party of the contract, that party is exempt from liability only if:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which the impediment exists.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other than to claim damages under this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 80</p>
<p class="indent">A party may not rely on a failure of the other party to perform, to the extent that such failure was caused by the first party&#8217;s act or omission.</p>
<p class="head3">Section V. Effects of avoidance</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 81</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Avoidance of the contract releases both parties from their obliga- tions under it, subject to any damages which may be due. Avoidance does not affect any provision of the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other provision of the contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties consequent upon the avoidance of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A party who has performed the contract either wholly or in part may claim restitution from the other party of whatever the first party has supplied or paid under the contract. If both parties are bound to make restitution, they must do so concurrently.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 82</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The preceding paragraph does not apply:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution of the goods substantially in the condi- tion in which the buyer received them is not due to his act or omission;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if the goods or part of the goods have perished or deterio- rated as a result of the examination provided for in article 38; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 83</p>
<p class="indent">A buyer who has lost the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods in accordance with article 82 retains all other remedies under the contract and this Convention.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 84</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the seller is bound to refund the price, he must also pay interest on it, from the date on which the price was paid.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The buyer must account to the seller for all benefits which he has derived from the goods or part of them:</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if he must make restitution of the goods or part of them; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if it is impossible for him to make restitution of all or part of the goods or to make restitution of all or part of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them, but he has nevertheless declared the contract avoided or re- quired the seller to deliver substitute goods.</p>
<p class="head3">Section VI. Preservation of the goods</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 85</p>
<p class="indent">If the buyer is in delay in taking delivery of the goods or, where pay- ment of the price and delivery of the goods are to be made concurrently, if he fails to pay the price, and the seller is either in possession of the goods or otherwise able to control their disposition, the seller must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to preserve them. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the buyer.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 86</p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the buyer has received the goods and intends to exercise any right under the contract or this Convention to reject them, he must take such steps to preserve them as are reasonable in the circumstances. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the seller.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at his disposal at their destination and he exercises the right to reject them, he must take possession of them on behalf of the seller, provided that this can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable incon- venience or unreasonable expense. This provision does not apply if the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on his behalf is present at the destination. If the buyer takes possession of the goods under this paragraph, his rights and obligations are governed by the pre- ceding paragraph.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Article 87</p>
<p class="indent">A party who is bound to take steps to preserve the goods may deposit them in a warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party provided that the expense incurred is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="head4-article">Article 88</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable delay by the other party in taking possession of the goods or in taking them back or in paying the price or the cost of preser- vation, provided that reasonable notice of the intention to sell has been given to the other party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the goods are subject to rapid deterioration or their preserva- tion would involve unreasonable expense, a party who is bound to pre- serve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them. To the extent possible he must give notice to the other party of this intention to sell.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A party selling the goods has the right to retain out of the pro- ceeds of sale an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of preserving the goods and of selling them. He must account to the other party for the balance.</p>
<p class="chap-title"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>UNIDROIT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS</b></p>
<p class="center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p class="head1"><b>COMPILERS&#8217; NOTE<sup>1</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent">In 1994, an important body of rules for international contracts, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, was pro- mulgated.<b><sup>2</sup></b> Like the Restatements, the Principles are not designed for legislative enactment. What is the source of these Principles? &#8220;For the most part,&#8221; their Introduction explains, they &#8220;reflect concepts to be found in many, if not all, legal systems,&#8221; though &#8220;they also embody what are perceived to be the best solutions, even if still not yet generally adopted.&#8221; These concepts are drawn from a variety of sources such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), generally recognized principles of civil law systems, and general- ly recognized principles of common law systems&#8212;including the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the Principles have not been enacted by a legislature, parties that want them to apply should incorporate them, either by name or gen- erally. According to their Preamble, they &#8220;set forth general rules for in- ternational commercial contracts&#8221; to be applied &#8220;when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by [them or by] &#8216;general principles of law,&#8217; the &#8216;lex mercatoria&#8217; or the like.&#8221; It is likely that their impact will be largely in international arbitration, and their Preamble suggests that arbitrators apply them if &#8220;it proves impossible to establish the relevant rule of the applicable law.&#8221; This might be the case if it is uncertain what law is applicable or if, though this is certain, that law lacks a clear rule. Because CISG covers international sales of goods, it is likely that the Principles will be significant in disputes arising under other types of con- tracts, notably contracts for services.</p>
<p class="indent">The Principles are the product of the same organization that began the work on the unification of the law of international sales, the Interna- tional Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) in Rome. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>Founded in 1926 under the auspices of the League of Nations, it has con- tinued as an independent governmental organization of which the United States is a member. The idea of drafting the Principles dates back to 1971, when the topic was put on the Institute&#8217;s work program, but it was not until 1980 that the Institute set up a working group, which the Unit- ed States joined toward the end of that decade. After more than a decade of semiannual meetings of the working group, the Institute&#8217;s Governing Council approved publication of the Principles in 1994. Like the Restate- ment and the Uniform Commercial Code, they are accompanied by com- ments, illustrations, and section captions. Their initial success was such that the set of Principles has been expanded twice&#8212;in 2004 and 2011. A similar effort, under different auspices, has prepared a set of Principles of European Contract Law.<b><sup>3</sup></b></p>

<p class="indent">The Principles contain some 211 articles and deal with such matters as contract formation, performance, excuse from performance, and rem- edies. As to many of these matters they track the provisions of CISG. On some matters, however, the Principles break fresh ground. These include precontractual liability, hardship as an excuse for nonperformance, spe- cific performance, and stipulated damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The Principles also break fresh ground by stating a number of general principles. One is freedom of contract: &#8220;parties are free to enter into a contract and to determine its contents&#8221;<b><sup>4</sup></b> and &#8220;may exclude the applica- tion of these Principles &#8230; or vary [their] effect.&#8221;<b><sup>5</sup></b> A second is <i>pacta sunt servanda</i> (agreements are to be observed): if &#8220;performance becomes more onerous for one of the parties, that party is nevertheless bound to per- form its obligations.&#8221;<b><sup>6</sup></b> A third is fairness: a party may avoid a contract or term &#8220;if, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the contract or term unjustifiably gave the other party an excessive advantage,&#8221;<b><sup>7</sup></b> and a term &#8220;contained in standard terms&#8221; that &#8220;is of such a character that the other party could not reasonably have expected it&#8221; is not effective unless expressly accepted by that party.<b><sup>8</sup></b> A fourth is good faith and fair dealing: a &#8220;party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in inter- national trade.&#8221;<b><sup>9</sup></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Principles raise troublesome questions concerning mandatory rules&#8212;rules that the parties are not free to change by agreement. Given that the Principles are generally applicable only as a result of agreement of the parties, one might make two assumptions as to mandatory rules. The first is that the parties would be completely free to exclude or modify the Principles, an assumption that seems to be confirmed by the principle of freedom of contract mentioned above. The second is that the parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>could not themselves exclude or modify mandatory rules of the applicable law, an assumption that seems to be confirmed by a provision that the Principles do not &#8220;restrict the application of mandatory rules &#8230; which are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private interna- tional law.&#8221;<b><sup>10</sup></b></p>

<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>4</sup></b> Art. 1.1 (&#8220;Freedom of contract&#8221;).</p>
<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>5</sup></b> Art. 1.5 (&#8220;Exclusion or modification by the parties&#8221;).</p>

<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>9</sup></b> Art. 1.7 (&#8220;Good faith and fair dealing&#8221;).</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps surprisingly, the Principles qualify both assumptions. As to the first assumption, despite the general principle of freedom of contract, the Principles subject their declaration that they may be excluded or varied by the parties to an exception where &#8220;otherwise provided in the Principles.&#8221;<b><sup>11</sup></b> These exceptions include the rules on good faith and fair dealing<b><sup>12</sup></b> and on gross disparity.<b><sup>13</sup></b> It is, to be sure, unlikely that parties would include in their contracts explicit provisions derogating from either of these rules, but if they were to do so it might be difficult to explain why such provisions should not be given effect. As to the second assumption, despite the statement that the Principles cannot affect mandatory rules, the Principles seem to contemplate exceptions as to the requirement of a writing, the requirement for modification of an agreement, the availabil- ity of specific performance, and the enforceability of a provision for stipu- lated damages. As to all of these, the Principles state rules that change common law rules that the parties cannot change by agreement&#8212;com- mon law mandatory rules.</p>

<p class="indent">At its 83rd session in 2004 the Governing Council of UNIDROIT ad- opted a second edition of the UNIDROIT Principles. As compared to the 1994 edition, the new edition contained 5 additional chapters as well as an expanded Preamble and new provisions on Inconsistent Behaviour and on Release by Agreement. In addition, wherever appropriate the 1994 edition of the Principles were adapted to meet the needs of elec- tronic contracting.</p>
<p class="indent">At its 90th session the Governing Council of UNIDROIT adopted the third edition of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (&#8220;UNIDROIT principles 2010&#8221;). The UNIDROIT Principles 2010 contain new provisions on restitution in case of failed contracts, illegality, conditions, and plurality of obligors and obligees, while with respect to the text of the 2004 edition the only significant changes made relate to the Comments to Article 1.4.</p>
<p class="indent">The third edition of the UNIDROIT Principles consists of 211 Articles (as opposed to the 120 Articles of the 1994 edition and the 185 Articles of the 2004 edition) structured as follows: Preamble (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 1: General provisions (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 2, Section 1: Formation (<i>un- changed</i>); Section 2: Authority of agents (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 3, Section 1: General provisions (<i>containing former Articles 3.1</i> (<i>amended</i>), 3.2, 3.3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>and 3.19 (<i>amended</i>)), Section 2: Ground for avoidance (<i>containing former Articles 3.4 to 3.16, 3.17</i> (<i>amended</i>), <i>3.18 and 3.20, and a new Article 3.2.15</i>), Section 3: Illegality (<i>new</i>); Chapter 4: Interpretation (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 5, Section 1: Content (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 2: Third Party Rights (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 3: Conditions (<i>new</i>); Chapter 6, Section 1: Perfor- mance in general (<i>unchanged</i>), Section 2: Hardship (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 7, Section 1: Non-performance in general (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 2: Right to performance (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 3: Termination (<i>containing former Articles 7.3.1 to 7.3.5, 7.3.6</i> (<i>amended</i>) <i>and a new Article 7.3.7</i>), Section 4: Damages (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 8: Set-off (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 9, Section 1: Assignment of rights (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 2: Transfer of ob- ligations (<i>unchanged</i>); Section 3: Assignment of contracts (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 10: Limitation periods (<i>unchanged</i>); Chapter 11, Section 1: Plu- rality of obligors (<i>new</i>), Section 2: Plurality of obligees (<i>new</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">In 2016, a fourth edition of the UNIDROIT Principles was adopted. The main objective of the fourth edition of the UNIDROIT Principles is to take better into account the special needs of long-term contracts. To do so, the content of the 2010 edition has been altered only marginally: only six provisions have been amended, i.e. the Preamble and Articles 1.11, 2.1.14, 5.1.7, 5.1.8, and 7.3.7. Indeed, the majority of alterations were made to the Comments, in particular on the Preamble (amend- ments to Comment 2) and Articles 1.11 (addition of a new Comment 3), 2.1.14 (amendments to Comments 1&#8211;3 and addition of a new Comment 4), 2.1.15 (amendments to Comment 2 and addition of a new Comment 3), 4.3 (amendments to Comment 3 (which has become Comment 4) and addition of a new Comment 3), 4.8 (amendments to Comments 1&#8211;3), 5.1.3 (amendments to the Comment (which has become Comment 1) and ad- dition of a new Comment 2), 5.1.4 (addition of a new Comment 3), 5.1.7 (amendments to Comments 2&#8211;3), 5.1.8 (amendments to the Comment (which has become Comment 1) and addition of a new Comment 2), 7.1.7 (addition of a new Comment 5), 7.3.5 (amendments to Comment 3 and ad- dition of a new Comment 4), 7.3.6 (amendments to Comment 1), and 7.3.7 (amendments to Comments 1&#8211;2).</p>

<p class="indent">They may be used to interpret or supplement international uniform law instruments.</p>
<p class="indent">They may be used to interpret or supplement domestic law.</p>
<p class="indent">They may serve as a model for national and international legislators.</p>

<p class="indent">A party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 1.9</b> <br/><i>(Usages and practices)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">(3) The relevant time zone is that of the place of business of the party setting the time, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>CHAPTER 2&#8212;FORMATION AND AUTHORITY OF AGENTS</b></p>
<p class="head3"><b>SECTION 1: FORMATION</b></p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.1</b> <br/><i>(Manner of formation)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A contract may be concluded either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show agreement.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.2</b> <br/><i>(Definition of offer)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A proposal for concluding a contract constitutes an offer if it is suf- ficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.1.3</b> <br/><i>(Withdrawal of offer)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the with- drawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.4</b> <br/><i>(Revocation of offer)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revo- cation reaches the offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, an offer cannot be revoked</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that it is irrevocable; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as be- ing irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.5</b> <br/><i>(Rejection of offer)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An offer is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.6</b> <br/><i>(Mode of acceptance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An acceptance of an offer becomes effective when the indication of assent reaches the offeror.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective when the act is performed.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.7</b> <br/><i>(Time of acceptance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An offer must be accepted within the time the offeror has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time having regard to the circum- stances, including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.1.8</b> <br/><i>(Acceptance within a fixed period of time)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A period of acceptance fixed by the offeror begins to run from the time that the offer is dispatched. A time indicated in the offer is deemed to be the time of dispatch unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.9</b> <br/><i>(Late acceptance. Delay in transmission)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without undue delay the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a communication containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effec- tive as an acceptance unless, without undue delay, the offeror informs the offeree that it considers the offer as having lapsed.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.10</b> <br/><i>(Withdrawal of acceptance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.11</b> <br/><i>(Modified acceptance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but con- tains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, with- out undue delay, objects to the discrepancy. If the offeror does not object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.12</b> <br/><i>(Writings in confirmation)</i></p>
<p class="indent">If a writing which is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract and which purports to be a confirmation of the contract contains additional or different terms, such terms become part of the con- tract, unless they materially alter the contract or the recipient, without undue delay, objects to the discrepancy.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.1.13</b> <br/><i>(Conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specificmatters or in a particular form)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not concluded until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form, no contract is concluded before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.14</b> <br/><i>(Contract with terms deliberately left open)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If the parties intend to conclude a contract, the fact that they intentionally leave a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that sub- sequently</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) the parties reach no agreement on the term;</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) the party who is to determine the term does not do so; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(c) the third person does not determine the term,</p>
<p class="noindent">provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.15</b> <br/><i>(Negotiations in bad faith)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party is free to negotiate and is not liable for failure to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, a party who negotiates or breaks off negotiations in bad faith is liable for the losses caused to the other party.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) It is bad faith, in particular, for a party to enter into or continue negotiations when intending not to reach an agreement with the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.16</b> <br/><i>(Duty of confidentiality)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Where information is given as confidential by one party in the course of negotiations, the other party is under a duty not to disclose that in- formation or to use it improperly for its own purposes, whether or not a contract is subsequently concluded. Where appropriate, the remedy for breach of that duty may include compensation based on the benefit re- ceived by the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.1.17</b> <br/><i>(Merger clauses)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A contract in writing which contains a clause indicating that the writ- ing completely embodies the terms on which the parties have agreed can- not be contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior statements or agreements. However, such statements or agreements may be used to interpret the writing.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.18</b> <br/><i>(Modification in a particular form)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A contract in writing which contains a clause requiring any modifica- tion or termination by agreement to be in a particular form may not be otherwise modified or terminated. However, a party may be precluded by its conduct from asserting such a clause to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.19</b> <br/><i>(Contracting under standard terms)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where one party or both parties use standard terms in conclud- ing a contract, the general rules on formation apply, subject to Articles 2.1.20&#8211;2.1.22.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Standard terms are provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used with- out negotiation with the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.20</b> <br/><i>(Surprising terms)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) No term contained in standard terms which is of such a character that the other party could not reasonably have expected it, is effective un- less it has been expressly accepted by that party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In determining whether a term is of such a character regard shall be had to its content, language and presentation.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.1.21</b> <br/><i>(Conflict between standard terms and non-standard terms)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In case of conflict between a standard term and a term which is not a standard term the latter prevails.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.1.22</b> <br/><i>(Battle of forms)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Where both parties use standard terms and reach agreement except on those terms, a contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common in substance unless one party clearly indicates in advance, or later and without undue delay informs the other party, that it does not intend to be bound by such a contract.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>SECTION 2: AUTHORITY OF AGENTS</b></p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.1</b> <br/><i>(Scope of the Section)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) This Section governs the authority of a person (&#8220;the agent&#8221;) to affect the legal relations of another person (&#8220;the principal&#8221;) by or with respect to a contract with a third party, whether the agent acts in its own name or in that of the principal.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) It governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand, and the third party on the other.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) It does not govern an agent&#8217;s authority conferred by law or the authority of an agent appointed by a public or judicial authority.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.2</b> <br/><i>(Establishment and scope of the authority of the agent)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The principal&#8217;s grant of authority to an agent may be express or implied.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The agent has authority to perform all acts necessary in the cir- cumstances to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.3</b> <br/><i>(Agency disclosed)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent, the acts of the agent shall directly affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party and no legal relation is created between the agent and the third party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations be- tween the agent and the third party, where the agent with the consent of the principal undertakes to become the party to the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 2.2.4</b> <br/><i>(Agency undisclosed)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party neither knew nor ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent, the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, where such an agent, when contracting with the third party on behalf of a business, represents itself to be the owner of that business, the third party, upon discovery of the real owner of the busi- ness, may exercise also against the latter the rights it has against the agent.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.5</b> <br/><i>(Agent acting without or exceeding its authority)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where an agent acts without authority or exceeds its authority, its acts do not affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, where the principal causes the third party reasonably to believe that the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that the agent is acting within the scope of that authority, the prin- cipal may not invoke against the third party the lack of authority of the agent.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.6</b> <br/><i>(Liability of agent acting without or exceeding its authority)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority is, failing ratification by the principal, liable for damages that will place the third party in the same position as if the agent had acted with authority and not exceeded its authority.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, the agent is not liable if the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent had no authority or was exceeding its au- thority.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.7</b> <br/><i>(Conflict of interests)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) If a contract concluded by an agent involves the agent in a conflict of interests with the principal of which the third party knew or ought to have known, the principal may avoid the contract. The right to avoid is subject to Articles 3.2.9 and 3.2.11 to 3.2.15.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) However, the principal may not avoid the contract</p>
<p class="hang-indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(a) if the principal had consented to, or knew or ought to have known of, the agent&#8217;s involvement in the conflict of interests; or</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(b) if the agent had disclosed the conflict of interests to the prin- cipal and the latter had not objected within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.8</b> <br/><i>(Sub-agency)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An agent has implied authority to appoint a sub-agent to perform acts which it is not reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself. The rules of this Section apply to the sub-agency.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.9</b> <br/><i>(Ratification)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) An act by an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its au- thority may be ratified by the principal. On ratification the act produces the same effects as if it had initially been carried out with authority.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The third party may by notice to the principal specify a reason- able period of time for ratification. If the principal does not ratify within that period of time it can no longer do so.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If, at the time of the agent&#8217;s act, the third party neither knew nor ought to have known of the lack of authority, it may, at any time before ratification, by notice to the principal indicate its refusal to become bound by a ratification.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 2.2.10</b> <br/><i>(Termination of authority)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Termination of authority is not effective in relation to the third party unless the third party knew or ought to have known of it.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Notwithstanding the termination of its authority, an agent re- mains authorised to perform the acts that are necessary to prevent harm to the principal&#8217;s interests.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>CHAPTER 3&#8212;VALIDITY SECTION 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS</b></p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.1.1</b> <br/><i>(Matters not covered)</i></p>
<p class="indent">This Chapter does not deal with lack of capacity.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/><b>Article 3.1.2</b> <br/><i>(Validity of mere agreement)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A contract is concluded, modified or terminated by the mere agree- ment of the parties, without any further requirement.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.1.3</b> <br/><i>(Initial impossibility)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) The mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract a party was not entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract re- lates does not affect the validity of the contract.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.1.4</b> <br/><i>(Mandatory character of the provisions)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The provisions on fraud, threat, gross disparity and illegality con- tained in this Chapter are mandatory.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>SECTION 2: GROUNDS FOR AVOIDANCE</b></p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.1</b> <br/><i>(Definition of mistake)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Mistake is an erroneous assumption relating to facts or to law existing when the contract was concluded.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.2</b> <br/><i>(Relevant mistake)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) A party may only avoid the contract for mistake if, when the con- tract was concluded, the mistake was of such importance that a reason- able person in the same situation as the party in error would only have concluded the contract on materially different terms or would not have concluded it at all if the true state of affairs had been known, and</p>
<p class="hang-indent1">(a) the other party made the same mistake, or caused the mis- take, or knew or ought to have known of the mistake and it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error; or</p>

<p class="indent">A party is not entitled to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake if the circumstances on which that party relies afford, or could have af- forded, a remedy for non-performance.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.5</b> <br/><i>(Fraud)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other party&#8217;s fraudulent representation, including lan- guage or practices, or fraudulent non-disclosure of circumstances which, according to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, the latter party should have disclosed.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.6</b> <br/><i>(Threat)</i></p>
<p class="indent">A party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other party&#8217;s unjustified threat which, having regard to the circumstances, is so imminent and serious as to leave the first party no reasonable alternative. In particular, a threat is unjustified if the act or omission with which a party has been threatened is wrongful in itself, or it is wrongful to use it as a means to obtain the conclusion of the con- tract.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) A party may avoid the contract or an individual term of it if, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the contract or term unjustifi- ably gave the other party an excessive advantage. Regard is to be had, among other factors, to</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Upon the request of the party entitled to avoidance, a court may adapt the contract or term in order to make it accord with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A court may also adapt the contract or term upon the request of the party receiving notice of avoidance, provided that that party in- forms the other party of its request promptly after receiving such notice and before the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on it. Article 3.2.10(2) applies accordingly.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.8</b> <br/><i>(Third persons)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Where fraud, threat, gross disparity or a party&#8217;s mistake is im- putable to, or is known or ought to be known by, a third person for whose acts the other party is responsible, the contract may be avoided under the same conditions as if the behaviour or knowledge had been that of the party itself.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where fraud, threat or gross disparity is imputable to a third per- son for whose acts the other party is not responsible, the contract may be avoided if that party knew or ought to have known of the fraud, threat or disparity, or has not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) If a party is entitled to avoid the contract for mistake but the other party declares itself willing to perform or performs the contract as it was understood by the party entitled to avoidance, the contract is considered to have been concluded as the latter party understood it. The other party must make such a declaration or render such performance promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the party <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>entitled to avoidance had understood the contract and before that party has reasonably acted in reliance on a notice of avoidance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) After such a declaration or performance the right to avoidance is lost and any earlier notice of avoidance is ineffective.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.11</b> <br/><i>(Notice of avoidance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.12</b> <br/><i>(Time limits)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Notice of avoidance shall be given within a reasonable time, hav- ing regard to the circumstances, after the avoiding party knew or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable of acting freely.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where an individual term of the contract may be avoided by a party under Article 3.2.7, the period of time for giving notice of avoidance begins to run when that term is asserted by the other party.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.13</b> <br/><i>(Partial avoidance)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Where a ground of avoidance affects only individual terms of the con- tract, the effect of avoidance is limited to those terms unless, having re- gard to the circumstances, it is unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract.</p>

<p class="indent">Avoidance takes effect retroactively.</p>
<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.15</b> <br/><i>(Restitution)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) On avoidance either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract, or the part of it avoided, provided that the party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received un- der the contract, or the part of it avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate, an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(3) The recipient of the performance does not have to make an allow- ance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attribut- able to the other party.</p>

<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 3.2.16</b> <br/><i>(Damages)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Irrespective of whether or not the contract has been avoided, the party who knew or ought to have known of the ground for avoidance is liable for damages so as to put the other party in the same position in which it would have been if it had not concluded the contract.</p>

<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 6.2.2</b> <br/><i>(Definition of hardship)</i></p>
<p class="indent">There is hardship where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilibrium of the contract either because the cost of a party&#8217;s per- formance has increased or because the value of the performance a party receives has diminished, and</p>

<p class="indent">A party may not rely on the non-performance of the other party to the extent that such non-performance was caused by the first party&#8217;s act or omission or by another event for which the first party bears the risk.</p>

If it receives notice from the other party that the latter will not perform within that period, or if upon expiry of that period due performance has not been made, the aggrieved party may resort to any of the reme-dies that may be available under this Chap- ter.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where in a case of delay in performance which is not fundamen- tal the aggrieved party has given notice allowing an additional period of time of reasonable length, it may terminate the contract at the end of that period. If the additional period allowed is not of reasonable length it shall be extended to a reasonable length. The aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party fails to perform within the period allowed by the notice the contract shall automatically terminate.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Paragraph (3) does not apply where the obligation which has not been performed is only a minor part of the contractual obligation of the non-performing party.</p>

<p class="head4-article"><b>Article 7.1.7</b> <br/><i>(Force majeure)</i></p>
<p class="indent">(1) Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoid- ed or overcome it or its consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When the impediment is only temporary, the excuse shall have effect for such period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on its ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, it is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt.</p>

<p class="hang-indent1">(b) strict compliance with the obligation which has not been per- formed is of essence under the contract;</p>

<p class="noindent">(2) The sole purpose of this Agreement is to enable WILLIAM STERN and his infertile wife to have a child which is biologically related to WIL- LIAM STERN.</p>

<p class="noindent">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained Herein and the intentions of being legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent">1. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, represents that she is capa- ble of conceiving children.

<p class="fn_para"><b><sup>*</sup></b> Appendix A, 537 A2d 1227, 1265 (N.J.1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">3. WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, does hereby enter into this writ- ten contractual Agreement with MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, where MARY BETH WHITEHEAD shall be artificially inseminated with the semen of WILLIAM STERN by a physician. MARY BETH WHITE- HEAD, Surrogate, upon becoming pregnant, acknowledges that she will carry said embryo/fetus(s) until delivery. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITEHEAD, her husband, agree that they will cooperate with any background investigation into the Surrogate&#8217;s medical, family and personal history and warrants the information to be accurate to the best of their knowledge. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITEHEAD, her husband, agree to surren- der custody of the child to WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, immedi- ately upon birth, acknowledging that it is the intent of this Agreement in the best interests of the child to do so; as well as institute and cooperate in proceedings to terminate their respective parental rights to said child, and sign any and all necessary affidavits, documents, and the like, in or- der to further the intent and purposes of this Agreement. It is understood by MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, and RICHARD WHITEHEAD, that the child to be conceived is being done so for the sole purpose of giving said child to WILLIAM STERN, its natural and biological father. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD and RICHARD WHITEHEAD agree to sign all nec- essary affidavits prior to and after the birth of the child and voluntarily participate in any paternity proceedings necessary to have WILLIAM STERN&#8217;S name entered on said child&#8217;s birth certificate as the natural or biological father.</p>
<p class="noindent">4. That the consideration for this Agreement, which is compensation for services and expenses, and in no way is to be construed as a fee for termination of parental rights or a payment in exchange for a consent to surrender the child for adoption, in addition to other provisions contained herein, shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent">(A) $10,000 shall be paid to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, upon surrender of custody to WILLIAM STERN, the natural and biologi- cal father of the child born pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement for surrogate services and expenses in carrying out her obligations under this Agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent">(B) The consideration to be paid to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Sur- rogate, shall be deposited with the Infertility Center of New York (here- inafter ICNY), the representative of WILLIAM STERN, at the time of the signing of this Agreement, and held in escrow until completion of the duties and obligations of MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, (see Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; for a copy of the Escrow Agreement), as herein described.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>(C) WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall pay the expenses incurred by MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, pursuant to her pregnancy, more specifically defined as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent">(1) All medical, hospitalization, and pharmaceutical, laboratory and therapy expenses incurred as a result of MARY BETH WHITEHEAD&#8217;S pregnancy, not covered or allowed by her present health and major medi- cal insurance, including all extraordinary medical expenses and all rea- sonable expenses for treatment of any emotional or mental conditions or problems related to said pregnancy, but in no case shall any such ex- penses be paid or reimbursed after a period of six (6) months have elapsed since the date of the termination of the pregnancy, and this Agreement specifically excludes any expenses for lost wages or other non-itemized incidentals (see Exhibit &#8220;B&#8221;) related to said pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent">(2) WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall not be responsible for any latent medical expenses occurring six (6) weeks subsequent to the birth of the child, unless the medical problem or abnormality incident thereto was known and treated by a physician prior to the expiration of said six</p>
<p class="noindent">(6) week period and in written notice of the same sent to ICNY, as repre- sentative of WILLIAM STERN by certified mail, return receipt request- ed, advising of this treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">(3) WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall be responsible for the total costs of all paternity testing. Such paternity testing may, at the option of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, be required prior to release of the surrogate fee from escrow. In the event WILLIAM STERN, Natural Fa- ther, is conclusively determined not to be the biological father of the child as a result of an HLA test, this Agreement will be deemed breached and MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, shall not be entitled to any fee. WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall be entitled to reimbursement of all medical and related expenses from MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITEHEAD, her husband.</p>
<p class="noindent">(4) MARY BETH WHITEHEAD&#8217;S reasonable travel expenses incurred at the request of WILLIAM STERN, pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">5. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITE- HEAD, her husband, understand and agree to assume all risks, including the risk of death, which are incidental to conception, pregnancy, child- birth, including but not limited to, postpartum complications. A copy of said possible risks and/or complications is attached hereto and made a part hereof (see Exhibit &#8220;C&#8221;).</p>
<p class="noindent">6. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITE- HEAD, her husband, hereby agree to undergo psychiatric evaluation by JOAN EINWOHNER, a psychiatrist as designated by WILLIAM STERN or an agent thereof. WILLIAM STERN shall pay for the cost of said psy- chiatric evaluation. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD and RICHARD WHITE- HEAD shall sign, prior to their evaluations, a medical release permitting <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>dissemination of the report prepared as a result of said psychiatric evalu- ations to ICNY or WILLIAM STERN and his wife.</p>
<p class="noindent">7. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITE- HEAD, her husband, hereby agree that it is the exclusive and sole right of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, to name said child.</p>
<p class="noindent">8. &#8220;Child&#8221; as referred to in this Agreement shall include all children born simultaneously pursuant to the inseminations contemplated herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">9. In the event of the death of WILLIAM STERN, prior or subsequent to the birth of said child, it is hereby understood and agreed by MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and RICHARD WHITEHEAD, her hus- band, that the child will be placed in the custody of WILLIAM STERN&#8217;S wife.</p>
<p class="noindent">10. In the event that the child is miscarried prior to the fifth (5th) month of pregnancy, no compensation, as enumerated in paragraph 4(A), shall be paid to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate. However, the expens- es enumerated in paragraph 4(C) shall be paid or reimbursed to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate. In the event the child is miscarried, dies or is stillborn subsequent to the fourth (4th) month of pregnancy and said child does not survive, the Surrogate shall receive $1,000.00 in lieu of the compensation enumerated in paragraph 4(A). In the event of a miscarriage or stillbirth as described above, this Agreement shall termi- nate and neither MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, nor WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall be under any further obligation under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">11. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, shall have undergone complete physical and genetic evaluation, under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician, to determine whether the physical health and well-being of each is sat- isfactory. Said physical examination shall include testing for venereal diseases, specifically including but not limited to, syphilis, herpes and gonorrhea. Said venereal diseases testing shall be done prior to, but not limited to, each series of inseminations.</p>
<p class="noindent">12. In the event that pregnancy has not occurred within a reasonable time, in the opinion of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, this Agree- ment shall terminate by written notice to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, at the residence provided to the ICNY by the Surrogate, from ICNY, as representative of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father.</p>
<p class="noindent">13. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, agrees that she will not abort the children conceived except, if in the professional medical opinion of the inseminating physician, such action is necessary for the physical health of MARY BETH WHITEHEAD or the child has been determined by said physician to be physiologically abnormal. MARY BETH WHITE- HEAD further agrees, upon the request of said physician to undergo am- niocentesis (see Exhibit &#8220;D&#8221;) or similar tests to detect genetic and congenital <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" id="page_"/>defects. In the event said test reveals that the fetus is genetically or congenitally abnormal, MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, agrees to abort the fetus upon demand of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, in which event, the fee paid to the Surrogate will be in accordance to Para- graph 10. If MARY BETH WHITEHEAD refuses to abort the fetus upon demand of WILLIAM STERN, his obligations as stated in this Agreement shall cease forthwith, except as to obligation of paternity imposed by stat- ute.</p>
<p class="noindent">14. Despite the provisions of Paragraph 13, WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, recognizes that some genetic and congenital abnormalities may not be detected by amniocentesis or other tests, and therefore, if proven to be the biological father of the child, assumes the legal responsibility for any child who may possess genetic or congenital abnormalities. (See Exhibits &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8221;).</p>
<p class="noindent">15. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, further agrees to adhere to all medical instructions given to her by the inseminating physician as well as her independent obstetrician. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD also agrees not to smoke cigarettes, drink alcoholic beverages, use illegal drugs, or take non-prescription medications or prescribed medications without written consent from her physician. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD agrees to follow a prenatal medical examination schedule to consist of no fewer visits then: one visit per month during the first seven (7) months of pregnancy, two visits (each to occur at two-week intervals) during the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent">16. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, agrees to cause RICHARD WHITEHEAD, her husband, to execute a refusal of consent form as an- nexed hereto as Exhibit &#8220;G&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">17. Each party acknowledges that he or she fully understands this Agreement and its legal effect, and that they are signing the same freely and voluntarily and that neither party has any reason to believe that the other(s) did not freely and voluntarily execute said Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">18. In the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall be deemed severable from the remainder of this Agreement and shall not cause the invalidity or unen- forceability of the remainder of this Agreement. If such provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope or breadth, then said provision shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope or breadth permitted by law.</p>
<p class="noindent">19. The original of this Agreement, upon execution, shall be retained by the Infertility Center of New York, with photocopies being distributed to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate and WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, having the same legal effect as the original.</p>
